			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://travelexperta.com">Travel Experta - Central America Travel Expert - </a></p><div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><p>Costa Rica is not only home to five <a href="http://travelexperta.com/2009/06/worlds-most-endangered-turtles-come-home.html">species of sea turtles</a> (Leatherback, Green Sea, Loggerhead, Hawksbill, and Olive Ridley) nesting on both the Caribbean and Pacific Coasts, but to three nesting sites that are some of the most important in the world. Luckily for us, with such a strong turtle conservation movement to protect these animals that has been led by some of the best biologists, conservationists, and decitated park rangers, you can take guided turtle tours and watch these amazing creatures make their way to shore and lay their eggs. Let us arrange this magical experience for you.</p>
<h1><strong><span style="color: #000080;">This is where you can find Turtle Tours in Costa Rica:</span></strong></h1>
<h2><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>The North Caribbean</strong></span></h2>
<p>Tortuguero National Park is the largest nesting site for the <a href="http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/green-turtle/" target="_blank">Green Sea turtle</a> (Chelonia mydas) in the Western Hemisphere. In total the North Caribbean region there are just four species of turtles nesting on these protected beaches:</p>
<p><strong>- </strong>The Green Sea turtles nest from July to October<br />
<strong>- </strong>Loggerheads come in smaller numbers at the same time (July to October)<br />
<strong>- </strong>The Leatherback (largest turtle in the world) arrives from March to May<br />
<strong>- </strong>The Hawksbill&#8217;s season runs from March to October</p>
<p><strong>Did You Know?</strong></p>
<p>Female Green Sea turtles come back to their natal beach every two to three years. They nest several times in one season each time laying from 80 to 120 eggs. The eggs incubate for 60 days and you can watch the hatchlings make their way to sea.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="sea-turtles-tour" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7148/6532374309_6fef9c3363_z.jpg" alt="6532374309 6fef9c3363 z Turtle Tours in Costa Rica" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The South Caribbean</span></strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://travelexperta.com/2013/02/gandoca-manzanillo-national-wildlife-refuge-costa-rica.html">Gandoca-Manzanillo</a> Wildlife Refuge hosts four species of marine turtles: the Loggerhead, Green, Hawksbill, and Leatherback. For over 20 years the ANAI conservation organization has been a main component in protecting and researching the nesting habits of turtles in this region.</p>
<p>A bit further north in Cahuita, the Hawksbill sea turtles come to lay their eggs on Playa Negra from April to October.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The North Pacific</span></strong></h2>
<p>When the <a href="http://travelexperta.com/2009/11/guatemala-wildlife-8-thrilling-details-about-the-olive-ridley-sea-turtle.html">Olive Ridley sea turtles</a> come to lay their eggs, they don&#8217;t come out one by one, but in huge waves known as &#8220;arribadas&#8221; which means &#8220;tens of thousands at a time&#8221;. The most popular place to see this phenomena is at the Ostional National Wildlife Refuge. If you&#8217;re in this area any time between the months of May thru December (peak months are August to October), you are almost guaranteed to spot a turtle on any night.</p>
<p>One of the five most significant Leatherback turtle beaches in the world is on Playa Grande at the Las Baulas National Marine Park. Between the months of October thru March you can sign up for a guided night tour and see this magical giant lay her eggs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="turtle-tour" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7010/6532380515_d18bedf232_z.jpg" alt="6532380515 d18bedf232 z Turtle Tours in Costa Rica" width="640" height="480" /></p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #000080;">The South Pacific</span></strong></h2>
<p>Take a tour of Marino Ballena National Park and see the Hawksbill and Olive Ridley turtles lay their eggs anytime from May to November.</p>
<p>The majority of the turtle preservation projects are run by the Osa Sea Turtle Conservation in Drake Bay. Contact us if you want to take a great tour. There is an ongoing debate whether or not the Black turtle, which nests sporadically along the coast of the Osa Peninsula, is a sub-species of the Green Sea turtle, or its own species.</p>
<p><strong>Insider Facts</strong></p>
<p>Turtle numbers have been highly affected due to many factors, so for us to enjoy these creatures, on their home turfs, environmentally safe tours can be arranged with licensed guides or park rangers. Turtles are ultra sensitive to ambient light so cameras, video, or flash photography are strictly prohibited at night. The rangers and biologist are working hard for us to leave as little of a &#8220;footprint&#8221; as possible to keep the turtles coming back.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://travelexperta.com">Travel Experta - Central America Travel Expert - </a></p><div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><p>Hammocks are one of those travel toys that everyone wants to have. So, when you are hopping around a tropical country and buy a hammock from the side of the road, all of a sudden you are weighed down with unnecessary weight all for the romance of carrying a hammock.  However, <strong>travel hammocks</strong> don&#8217;t have to be heavy. As a matter for fact, they can be one of the lightest things in your bag.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="travel hammock" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8099/8622670585_8b70c2477f_z.jpg" alt="8622670585 8b70c2477f z Travel Hammock for Two   The Fun Has Just Begun" width="640" height="367" /></p>
<p>My kids are big hammock fans. The whole idea of swinging around while we&#8217;re chilling on some exotic island or enjoying mountain lodges makes their travel memories that much richer and fuller. The biggest problems with this is that not all places or hotels have hammocks, and if they do they can either be occupied or so dirty that I forbid it all together. Then the memory becomes &#8216;mama is bad&#8217; and &#8216;no one let&#8217;s us play in the hammock&#8217;.</p>
<p>Finally, after too many of these silly problems popping up over and over again, I decided to do something about it.</p>
<p>I bought a travel hammock and haven&#8217;t looked back!</p>
<p>Finding the right one is a fun game in itself, since you&#8217;re preparing for your next trip and anything to do with an upcoming trip for me is just amazing!</p>
<p>I found it! The <a href="http://www.eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com/product/DOUBLE-DELUXE.html" target="_blank">Eno&#8217;s Double Nest Deluxe Hammock</a>. It&#8217;s a <strong>portable hammock</strong> for two! This way my two boys have no more excuses. Plus, it teaches them to share and bond &#8211; another huge facet of family travel.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="portable hammock" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8536/8622685905_e588cbdbaa_z.jpg" alt="8622685905 e588cbdbaa z Travel Hammock for Two   The Fun Has Just Begun" width="429" height="640" /></p>
<p>Along with the hammock I also got the <a href="http://www.eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com/product/AST001.html" target="_blank">Atlas Hammock Suspension System</a>. This way all I need are two poles, trees, or anything that will let me clip it on and swing about. And it takes up almost no space at all in my bags.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="hammock suspension system" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8392/8579377083_155e7a2b84_z.jpg" alt="8579377083 155e7a2b84 z Travel Hammock for Two   The Fun Has Just Begun" width="640" height="586" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>How the Hammock Suspension System Works</strong></span></h2>
<p>So easy you&#8217;lll wonder why all hammock ropes aren&#8217;t like this.</p>
<p>1. Attach it to a pole or tree and loop the rope into place. Remarkably, it really stays in place and doesn&#8217;t move.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="hammock suspension system" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8399/8622687757_3871750a0c_z.jpg" alt="8622687757 3871750a0c z Travel Hammock for Two   The Fun Has Just Begun" width="640" height="519" /></p>
<p>2. Find the height that works best for your hammock &#8211; there are several loops that you can attach your hammock to for the best height. You can be as far off the ground as you want, or practically touching it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="eagles nest hammocks" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8112/8623786136_18128fddf0_z.jpg" alt="8623786136 18128fddf0 z Travel Hammock for Two   The Fun Has Just Begun" width="419" height="640" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>5 Amazing and Unbelievable Features of Our Travel Hammock and the Hammock Suspension System</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Weight</strong> &#8211; The hammock weighs 1.5 pounds and the suspension ropes less than one pound. In total this amazing toy is around 2.5 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Size</strong> &#8211; the hammock when it&#8217;s rolled up in it&#8217;s attached bag is about the size of a grapefruit. The straps look like two small, thick wallets.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="portable hammock" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8107/8580477344_083516dccf_z.jpg" alt="8580477344 083516dccf z Travel Hammock for Two   The Fun Has Just Begun" width="640" height="549" /></p>
<p><strong>Capacity and durability</strong> &#8211; the hammock and straps can hold up to 400 pounds. Even though it says it&#8217;s good for two people, but we&#8217;ve actually had a lot more in it. And if this thing can handle a bunch of crazy boys, you know it can handle anything!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="hammock for two" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8108/8622677039_618449b2c5_z.jpg" alt="8622677039 618449b2c5 z Travel Hammock for Two   The Fun Has Just Begun" width="640" height="393" /></p>
<p><strong>Breathability</strong> &#8211; the whole allure of the side-of-the-road hammocks is that they are made of string with lots of breathing room. Personally, I&#8217;ll take the breathing nylon material over that any day, which is what this hammock is made of. I can&#8217;t stand the way my body falls through the holes on a regular hammock. The Eno hammock supports me completely.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="eagles nest hammocks" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8522/8623785408_187a5eef4b_z.jpg" alt="8623785408 187a5eef4b z Travel Hammock for Two   The Fun Has Just Begun" width="640" height="493" /></p>
<p><strong>Stuff sack</strong> &#8211; the sack to roll it up in is attached! It&#8217;s super super easy to simply roll it up and stuff it in.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="free standing hammocks" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8379/8580472372_dc5067e859_z.jpg" alt="8580472372 dc5067e859 z Travel Hammock for Two   The Fun Has Just Begun" width="237" height="640" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My take on it</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest with you. Even though my kids and husband love hammocks, I have been quite indifferent to them &#8211; BEFORE NOW. And I&#8217;m really not just saying that because my family has fallen in love with it. But because it really is awesome. It&#8217;s so tiny, that I can bring it anywhere with us for our travels. It makes my kids so happy and gives me free time. And when everyone is off doing their thing, mama gets her break to simply relax and enjoy the view!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="travel hammock" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8382/8623779274_dfcdc7e784_z.jpg" alt="8623779274 dfcdc7e784 z Travel Hammock for Two   The Fun Has Just Begun" width="640" height="406" /></p>
<p><strong>Where to buy it</strong></p>
<p>I found the <a href="http://www.eaglesnestoutfittersinc.com/" target="_blank">Eagles Nest Outfitters website</a> to be the best option. For one, the selection is huge. Two, they know what works best with all their products as for accessories. Three, you never know what deals are going on until you visit the site. Four, the customer service is great. Five, it&#8217;s easy.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://travelexperta.com">Travel Experta - Central America Travel Expert - </a></p><div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><p>The package holiday has been a staple for British people for nearly 50 years now, with many families opting to spend their time on the sun-soaked Spanish beaches, rather than the UK’s rain-lashed ones. However, package holidays have decreased in popularity, falling from 47 per cent of the market share in 2003 to just 38 per cent in 2009.</p>
<p>Five years ago, an increasing number of Brits seemed to be opting to travel independently, booking their own great value flights and hotels and choosing their own itineraries. Since then, the sector has seen another rise in bookings and in 2012 had risen to 43 per cent of the market share. However, with this rise in package holiday preference came a fall in bookings to the typical destinations.</p>
<p>So why have holidays to popular resorts in Spain, Greece and the Mediterranean decreased and where is everyone going now?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6046/6390950121_062472d1b0_z.jpg" alt="6390950121 062472d1b0 z Why Holidays to Popular European Destinations Have Decreased   Where is Everyone Going?" width="640" height="480" title="Why Holidays to Popular European Destinations Have Decreased   Where is Everyone Going?" /></p>
<p><strong>The original package bookers</strong></p>
<p>A generation ago, foreign holidays were new for many. For the first time, mass access to air travel was possible, and the Spanish coast was hugely popular. Those with a bit more money and the taste for adventure opted for the Greek Islands or Portugal.</p>
<p>Soon, our horizons spread further &#8211; Greece and France where soon replaced by Florida.</p>
<p><strong>The rise of the independent traveller</strong></p>
<p>A perfect storm of cut-price international airfares, rising disposable incomes and the amazing window-on-the-world that is the Internet, facilitated access to such corners of the globe as were only previously only read about in National Geographic not long ago. Finding package tours were just not ‘adventurous’ enough anymore, travellers began booking independent trips to ever more exotic locations like Central America.</p>
<p>Holidaymakers no longer wanted to lounge in the sun, instead preferring to soak up some culture in a distant land, haggle for bargains in a busy bazaar and see the sun setting over a strange and foreign land. The package holiday was squeezed out and replaced by eco-tours and adventure trips, at least for those who could afford them.</p>
<p><strong>The response of the travel industry</strong></p>
<p>Package tour operators noted these trends and made a conscious effort to shift their offerings to more exciting destinations. Nowadays, it is almost as cheap to go to Latin America as it is to spend a vacation on the Costas, and if you aren’t bothered about the sun and sea, there are a wealth of places covered by the package providers that fall inland and still offer a cultural experience.</p>
<p>The holidaymaking population have responded wholeheartedly, particularly since the economic crisis of recent years. These days, people are returning to the package tour operators for <a href="http://www.co-operativetravel.co.uk/cheap/last-minute-holidays/" target="_blank">last minute holidays</a> and pre-booked trips, because they appreciate and desire the security that goes with having a big name company to take care of everything. So package holidays are on the up again &#8211; but the destinations we are choosing are often very different.</p>
<p>In the modern world, it is likely our tour operator will be whisking us off to Cuba or Central America, which is good news for them and great value for us.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://travelexperta.com">Travel Experta - Central America Travel Expert - </a></p><div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><p>Taking a cruise is no longer the preserve of the ultra-rich. Cruises are now egalitarian affairs, a great number of which are family friendly. It is also a great way to have fun and experience different things from the ones you experience in Central America.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to get a head start on things and want to book your summer 2013 cruise, here are some of the hottest locations this year:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7084/7229700894_8c29cd286c_z.jpg" alt="7229700894 8c29cd286c z Book Some of the Summer’s Hottest Cruises in 2013 to Get Away from Central America" width="640" height="424" title="Book Some of the Summer’s Hottest Cruises in 2013 to Get Away from Central America" /></p>
<p><strong>Mediterranean</strong></p>
<p>If you’re new to cruises and you’re embarking on an adventure of this sort for the first time, the Mediterranean is a great starting point. Visiting Spain, Greece and Italy may not seem as exotic as some of the other possibilities on offer, but their proximity to England means travelling a shorter distance and there’s plenty to see and do; these Mediterranean destinations have much to offer in their own right.</p>
<p>Travelling with a company renowned for providing high-quality service, such as <a href="http://www.co-operativetravel.co.uk/cruises/family-cruises/" target="_blank">Co-operative family cruises</a>, you can sleep soundly in the knowledge that your every whim will be catered to. From spacious living quarters, to fine dining and family-friendly entertainment, a cruise is an inherently relaxing experience.</p>
<p>The real fun, however, begins once you step onto dry land. Whether you’re exploring Barcelona’s famous La Rambla, enjoying the lively and artistic culture of the Gaudi quarter, standing in awe outside the Acropolis in Athens, or exploring the ruins of Pompeii close to Naples, a cruise is a chance to immerse yourself in European culture.</p>
<p><strong>Venice</strong></p>
<p>The romance of Venice continues to draw crowds and should be high on your list of cruise holiday destinations.</p>
<p>Venice has something for everyone: its medieval churches, domes, bell towers, palaces and piazzas provide the perfect setting for a romantic meal and evening stroll with your partner.</p>
<p>If you have kids, however, there’s no need to panic. A cruise to Venice in 2013 could be your opportunity to recapture the passion in your relationship, enjoying all that the city has to offer. All the while, you can rest safe in the knowledge that your kids are under the watchful eye of your ship’s counsellors, having a great time and making new friends as part of a dedicated youth programme.</p>
<p><strong>Adriatic</strong></p>
<p>Choosing to take a cruise in the Adriatic not only gives you the opportunity to see Venice, it also offers holidaymakers a chance to see some other truly fantastic sites.</p>
<p>The Croatian city of Sibenik is one of the prettiest seaside towns in the Adriatic. With a UNESCO protected church at its very heart, the 150 islands off its coast provide myriad stunning vistas, including the awe-inspiring waterfalls of Krka National Park.</p>
<p>Croatia’s delights continue to abound in the city of Dubrovnik. The cobbled streets and its 17th-century cathedral provide an air of romance and intrigue that will leave you spellbound, while the surrounding Elaphite Islands’ pine forests, beaches and olive groves provide a picturesque setting for the more adventurous explorer.</p>
<p>Your Adriatic cruise culminates in the relaxing area of Corfu. Dozing under the hot summer sun on the golden sands of Glyfada beach, is the perfect way to let your worries fade away as the sun sets on your trip of a lifetime.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://travelexperta.com">Travel Experta - Central America Travel Expert - </a></p><div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><p>Do you struggle with sunglasses and prescription lenses? This seems to be a huge complaint for my dad who constantly is on the look for the right type of <strong>sunglasses to wear over his glasses. </strong>He tried doing the prescription glasses that get tinted over, but he said they never get dark enough and a lot of sunlight still enters from the sides and they simply don&#8217;t make larger styled prescription glasses for him.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when I decided to take matters into my own hands. Cause, frankly, I&#8217;m sick of his whining! That&#8217;s how I found <a href="http://www.cocoonseyewear.com/" target="_blank">Cocoons Eyewear</a>. This company specializes in many types of sunglasses from clip ons to sunglasses that fit over all types of prescription glasses.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="sunglasses over prescription glasses" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8528/8586028263_bf8fb8ff82_z.jpg" alt="8586028263 bf8fb8ff82 z Looking for Sunglasses Over Glasses? Heres One To Consider" width="640" height="481" /></p>
<p>After contacting them personally, to get the best ones for my dad, we decided to go with the <a href="http://www.cocoonseyewear.com/sunwear/category.php?id=1" target="_blank">Aviator Design</a>. What they did was send me a <a href="http://www.cocoonseyewear.com/files/Cocoons%20Sizing%20Guide.pdf" target="_blank">special guide</a> for exactly these types of questions that help with sizes, styles and so much more.  It&#8217;s one of the most thorough, helpful guides I&#8217;ve seen. And the customer service was great with all my questions.</p>
<p><strong>Features of these Sunglasses Over Glasses</strong></p>
<p><strong>Size matters</strong> &#8211; there are tons of different shapes and sizes of prescription glasses, and plenty of choices for different styles to fit over them</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="sunglasses over glasses" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8526/8586030323_f50728d16a_z.jpg" alt="8586030323 f50728d16a z Looking for Sunglasses Over Glasses? Heres One To Consider" width="640" height="486" /></p>
<p><strong>Polarized glasses</strong> &#8211; they are 100% polarized with all different tints for your liking. The polarization helps prevent that annoying glare and reflection.</p>
<p><strong>Colored Frames</strong> &#8211; What&#8217;s your favorite color? I bet you can find the one you like most.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="polarized lenses" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8528/8586077635_6d5e3a7b36_z.jpg" alt="8586077635 6d5e3a7b36 z Looking for Sunglasses Over Glasses? Heres One To Consider" width="640" height="280" /></p>
<p><strong>Fitted Temples</strong> &#8211; With glasses having to fit over the prescription ones, it&#8217;s important that they fit snugly and comfortably around your temple and ears.</p>
<p><strong>360 degree protection</strong> &#8211; the glasses cover from all angles.</p>
<p><strong>Accessories</strong> &#8211; it comes with a really cool case that you can clip on to anything, your pants, bag, etc&#8230;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="cocoons eyewear review" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8250/8587180924_ee67f1cbb4_z.jpg" alt="8587180924 ee67f1cbb4 z Looking for Sunglasses Over Glasses? Heres One To Consider" width="640" height="291" /></p>
<p><strong>Where to Buy them</strong></p>
<p>I did all the questioning and enquiries via the <a href="http://shop.liveeyewear.com/" target="_blank">website</a>. However, they work with a ton of <a href="http://www.cocoonseyewear.com/find_a_dealer/" target="_blank">dealers</a> that might work better for you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://travelexperta.com">Travel Experta - Central America Travel Expert - </a></p><div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><p>Orlando is a modern city in the middle of Florida. It is famous for being home to some of the best amusement parks in the world. But there are tons of other fun things to do, and places to visit in it. So don’t limit yourself to the parks on your next vacation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5283/5337517337_2a3cdb4d66_z.jpg" alt="5337517337 2a3cdb4d66 z 4 Things to do in Orlando" width="640" height="421" title="4 Things to do in Orlando" /></p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Here are 4 recommendations on things to do in Orlando:</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong>visit the Beaches &#8211; </strong>Orlando is a modern city, surrounded by beautiful beaches. You can enjoy all of the amenities of a beach destination and still have everything that you may need from a city, just steps away.<br />
<strong>Water Parks &#8211; </strong>The city is also packed with water parks for families and people of all ages. The weather is perfect for them almost year long.<br />
<strong>Sea World &#8211; </strong>A visit to Orlando, Florida cannot be complete without a visit to Sea World. It is a place filled with fun exhibits and the famous show of Shamu the Whale.<br />
<strong>Festivities &#8211; </strong>What do you want? Concerts, parades, music festivals, parades, film shows, food events? Orlando has it all! So make sure you do some research about the <a href="http://www.milescarrentalorlando.com/calendar-of-events-orlando.php" target="_blank">popular events in the Orlando Area</a> that will take place during your visit.</p>
<p>These are just a couple of things that you can do in Orlando. I’m sure that if you don’t like these, you will find some others with just a tiny bit of research. So dare to be different!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://travelexperta.com">Travel Experta - Central America Travel Expert - </a></p><div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><p>Kids have this funny tendency, when they go swimming, to stay in a pool all day long. This makes it an impossible task to put sunscreen on them more than the initial chance. Yet the sun doesn&#8217;t get any milder. So what to do? <span style="font-size: 16px;">I decided the best solution was to get  </span><strong style="font-size: 16px;">UV swimwear for kids</strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">. </span></p>
<p>But my three year old isn&#8217;t as easy to please as most toddlers his age. I had to do some serious searching for him to want the design. <a href="http://www.onestepahead.com/" target="_blank">One Step Ahead</a> has quite a selection to choose from. Granted, I showed him the sun protective swimwear <a href="http://www.onestepahead.com/thumbnail/Clothing-Sun-Smarties-Apparel/_/N-2iww" target="_blank">shirt online</a> and by the time it arrived he had long forgotten we even bothered to do it. So I held my breath when it was time to put it on him.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px;">It was a hit from the start. Along with not wanting to get out of the pool all day, he didn&#8217;t want to part with his shirt either. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="UV swimwear for kids" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8251/8602649751_1afaa78790_z.jpg" alt="8602649751 1afaa78790 z UV Swimwear for Kids   One Step Ahead Review" width="331" height="640" /></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 1.8em;">Fun Info on UV Swimwear for Kids</strong></p>
<p>Aside from the adorable shark design here&#8217;s what the shirt really is great for:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title=" Sun Protective Swimwear" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8104/8602648613_a4155043fc_z.jpg" alt="8602648613 a4155043fc z UV Swimwear for Kids   One Step Ahead Review" width="574" height="640" /></p>
<p><strong>Sun Protection</strong> &#8211; the shirt is UPF 50+ perfect for UV protection</p>
<p><strong>Design</strong> &#8211; it&#8217;s longer than the usual shirt for his age, it&#8217;s made that way for better coverage</p>
<p><strong>Ease of Use</strong> &#8211; you throw it on him and he doesn&#8217;t even know that he&#8217;s being protected. And to have it washed, is a quick throw in the laundry machine and it&#8217;s as good as new.</p>
<p><strong>Where to Buy it</strong></p>
<p>I found the buying process very easy via their website. Plus, whenever you go on it, you will almost always find a discount or special sale. So make sure to keep up with what they are doing.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://travelexperta.com">Travel Experta - Central America Travel Expert - </a></p><div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><p>While traveling we all worry about not getting sick for two reasons. No one wants to spend their vacations lying on a hotel bed and because we don’t always trust the doctors of the place we want to visit. I was one of those people but all of a sudden, in the middle of our trip in Cahuita, Costa Rica, my son became sick. Should I trust the <a href="http://travelexperta.com/2012/07/tips-traveling-central-america.html">Costa Rica healthcare</a> system?</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #000080;">This is how we discovered what Costa Rica Healthcare is really like:</span></strong></h2>
<p>My son&#8217;s sickness really put me in a lot of trouble and proved once again that nothing is perfect. He was burning up and waking up in the middle of the night crying from a sore throat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Social-Security-of-Costa-Rica" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3655/3368385165_11030fc269.jpg" alt="3368385165 11030fc269 Costa Rica Healthcare   Public Clinics" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>So I started to look for a private clinic or a <a href="http://travelexperta.com/2009/07/weekly-travel-tips-emergency-numbers.html">doctor in Costa Rica</a>, because of the horrible stories I had heard about public <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_Costa_Rica" target="_blank">clinics in Costa Rica</a>. But after running around looking for a private solution, I had to accept the fact that they were all closed and resigned to take my son to the public clinic.</p>
<p>The clinic was about 15 minutes from Cahuita and was squeaky clean. They requested for my paper works and since I&#8217;m not a resident and I do not have any formal documentation, they treated me as a tourist. They hurried let us see the next available doctor. Our experience there was awesome. The doctor was very good with kids, was fluent in English and extremely professional. We didn&#8217;t have to pay for anything, not even medicine.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Public-Clinic-in-Costa-Rica" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3625/3368384381_bbe9d48e30.jpg" alt="3368384381 bbe9d48e30 Costa Rica Healthcare   Public Clinics" width="500" height="375" /></p>
<p>Great medical service and medication for free? I was amazed at this and compared that with the situation in United States, you can easily understand our surprise and absolute gratefulness for their generosity. After this lovely experience, how I felt about the public hospitals has changed and filled my heart with great appreciation.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m trying to say is if you do get sick and have to visit a public <a href="http://travelexperta.com/destinations/costa-rica/info-on-costa-rica">clinic in Costa Rica</a>, know that you are in good hands!</p>

Clothes that will serve many purposes, right? My most versatile piece of clothing, when I did my gap year, was a sarong. This thing was good for just about anything. However, I&#8217;m older now and like to have classier clothes. Until now I didn&#8217;t even know they existed. But now I have proof &#8211; I found the perfect piece for me! <a href="https://www.aventuraclothing.com/collections/2-in-1-convertible-dress/P22072HG-27/detail" target="_blank">2 in 1 <strong>convertible dress</strong>.</a> But it&#8217;s really not 2 in 1, but more like 5 in 1.</p>
<p><strong>My searches for clothes usually have a lot to do with what&#8217;s important to me:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">I love eco clothing, it&#8217;s what I try to pick over everything else</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Dresses &#8211; I&#8217;m a huge skirt and dress fan</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 16px;">Companies with a good purpose</span></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://aventuraclothing.com/" target="_blank">Aventura Clothing</a> had all these qualities and a lot more. But when I found the convertible dress, I was instantly sold!</p>
<p>The family run business&#8217;s motto is:  &#8217;Helping the Earth&#8230; One garment at a time&#8217;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>The fun of a Convertible Dress / Skirt</strong></span></h2>
<p>When I opened my package I was surprised to find an instructional guide to how to use the dress. At first I wasn&#8217;t sure what to do with it, but then I realized without I wouldn&#8217;t know that you can wear it in five different styles.</p>
<p>As with all clothes and styles not everything will work for you. Out of the five, I felt super comfortable and sexy with three:</p>
<p>Skirt &#8211; by far my most favorite look</p>

<p>Maxi Dress &#8211; Straps Around My Neck</p>

<p>Maxi Dress &#8211; No Straps</p>

<p><strong>Where to Buy It</strong></p>
<p>I found their website to be fun to navigate, addicting, and easy to shop from. Their customer service is top of the line, super helpful and great to work with!</p>
<p>There is no difference that eco clothing and regular clothing give you, except that you know you are doing good and helping keeping our Mother Earth healthy and happy. Go eco, it&#8217;s more fun.</p>
