				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy Friday Wormy Worms!</p>
<p>The internet is chock full of cool stuff you can buy. Sure, a lot of it is ridiculous and/or prohibitively expensive, but it&#8217;s fun to look at. Sooooo&#8230; Let&#8217;s go shopping for bookish nonsense!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/carroll-pillow.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1745" alt="carroll pillow" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/carroll-pillow.jpg?w=228&#038;h=222" width="228" height="222" /></a></p>
<p>Yowza. That handsome devil on the throw pillow is Lewis Carroll. How much fun would this be in your living room? You can find these bad boys at <a href="http://www.uncommongoods.com/product/decorative-literary-caricature-pillows" target="_blank">Uncommon Goods</a>, which is full of cool random stuff. They have an entire line of quirky literary throw pillows for all your decorating needs.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/bigbookstote.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1746" alt="bigbookstote" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/bigbookstote.jpg?w=356&#038;h=348" width="356" height="348" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen this joke a zillion times, but I never get tired of it. The magic of Sir Mix-A-Lot and a tribute to chunkster books? Ooooh yeah. This baby can be purchased for a reasonable price at <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/+big_books_tote_bag,745833296" target="_blank">Cafepress</a>, and I really want one!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/origamiowlbooklocket.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1747" alt="origamiowlbooklocket" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/origamiowlbooklocket.jpg?w=365&#038;h=367" width="365" height="367" /></a></p>
<p>Okay. So. <a href="http://www.origamiowl.com/" target="_blank">Origami Owl</a> is like the new Tupperware. You know, the lady parties where you buy stuff you don&#8217;t really need and then feel guilty about it? I hate those things. But I don&#8217;t hate Origami Owl, because I think this locket is fabulous. It helps that I haven&#8217;t been invited to a party yet. You don&#8217;t HAVE to go to one of those parties to acquire this sweet locket, you can order them online with no sales pitch. I&#8217;d call that a big win for the antisocial.</p>
<p><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/litphonecase.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1748" alt="litphonecase" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/litphonecase.jpg?w=660"   /></a></p>
<p>Awwww yeah. You can get literary figures on your cell phone cases now. Just make sure you turn off the uh, &#8220;telltale&#8221; tone before the movie starts, mmmkay? I found this <a href="http://shop.outofprintclothing.com/Pop_Poe_iPhone_case_p/p-1004.htm" target="_blank">HERE</a>. They have classic book covers too!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/socksforworms.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1749" alt="socksforworms" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/socksforworms.jpg?w=215&#038;h=316" width="215" height="316" /></a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I find plain white socks impossibly drab. My own sock drawer contains a lot of argyle, striped tube socks, and penguin socks of endless variety. But you know what it&#8217;s missing? These bookworm socks from <a href="http://thesockmonster.com/index.php/all/shop-by-brand/socksmith/bookwormss.html" target="_blank">The Sockmonster!</a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/bookwormonesie.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1750" alt="bookwormonesie" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/bookwormonesie.jpg?w=337&#038;h=328" width="337" height="328" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been going to a whole heck of a lot of baby showers lately, and now I know what the next baby on my list will be getting! Perhaps I&#8217;ll just buy one for myself for my eventual offspring. <a href="http://www.cafepress.ca/mf/65564430/future-bookworm_bodysuit" target="_blank">Cafepress</a> is just too much fun. TOO MUCH!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/bookcharmbracelet.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1751" alt="bookcharmbracelet" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/bookcharmbracelet.jpg?w=341&#038;h=341" width="341" height="341" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/56405261/bookish-charm-bracelet-literary-book" target="_blank">Etsy, Etsy, Etsy</a>! You lure me in with your delightful accessories, and then you make them bookish? I mean, COME ON! The letter charms are made out of typewriter keys. How am I supposed to resist this?!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/bookmug.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1752" alt="bookmug" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/bookmug.jpg?w=263&#038;h=270" width="263" height="270" /></a></p>
<p>I like mugs. They hold all the warm beverages that go so nicely with books. I really dig this mug (which I found, again, on <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/+louisa_may_alcott_too_many_books_mug,597189745" target="_blank">Cafepress</a>) because this quote cracks me up. If memory serves, Aunt March said this about Jo in <em>Little Women. </em>Aunt March was such a cantankerous old biddy, and then she goes and leaves Jo Plumfield. I love it when the thorny ones have hearts of gold!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/bookscarf.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1753" alt="bookscarf" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/bookscarf.jpg?w=331&#038;h=337" width="331" height="337" /></a></p>
<p>Who doesn&#8217;t love a scarf? Who doesn&#8217;t love <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>? This scarf is printed with Jane Austen&#8217;s delicious prose! <a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/88642480/pride-and-prejudice-book-scarf" target="_blank">Etsy</a>, what are you DOING to me?!?!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/bookpurse.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1754" alt="bookpurse" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/bookpurse.jpg?w=343&#038;h=255" width="343" height="255" /></a></p>
<p>BOOK PURSE! Seriously, how cool is this? It&#8217;s a book that&#8217;s a purse. You can hold your stuff inside a copy of <em><a title="Bronte-Saurus Part Two: Jane Eyre" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/10/15/bronte-saurus-part-two-jane-eyre/" target="_blank">Jane Eyre</a>. </em><a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/71700282/jane-eyre-book-purse?ref=shop_home_active" target="_blank">Etsy</a>, you are one saucy minx. If you weren&#8217;t an inanimate internet marketplace, I&#8217;d kiss you!</p>
<p>So Bookworms, anybody out there got booktastic items they&#8217;d like to share with the class?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vedui&#8217; Parma Loki!</p>
<p>Oh yeah. That just happened. I just greeted y&#8217;all in ELVISH. Thanks to some random internet<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/empire2/angora5/Translator.html" target="_blank"> English to Elvish translator</a>, I was able to come up with &#8220;Greetings Book Snakes!&#8221; (Worms was not listed in the translator. I improvised.) I have a feeling if, say, Legolas, were out there reading my blog, he&#8217;d be all, &#8220;You&#8217;re bastardizing my people&#8217;s beautiful language!&#8221; Luckily, Elvish isn&#8217;t a real language, so I doubt I&#8217;ll catch too much flack. YES! I FINALLY started the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings" target="_blank"><em>Lord of the Rings </em></a>trilogy! I just finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Fellowship-Ring-Lord-Rings/dp/1594130078" target="_blank"><em>The Fellowship of the Ring </em></a>by JRR Tolkien, and you bet your sweet lembas bread I&#8217;ve got some things to say. I may as well just go ahead an give a big fat SPOILER ALERT for this whole review, but really, if you haven&#8217;t read the book, seen the movies, or have any concept of the story, you probably don&#8217;t care. However. I&#8217;m working on being RESPONSIBLE, see?</p>
<div id="attachment_1733" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 192px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/fellowship.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1733" alt="fellowship" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/fellowship.jpg?w=182&#038;h=274" width="182" height="274" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Nerd Cred!</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">You m<em></em>ay recall a while back I read and reviewed <em><a title="I Finally Read The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/12/10/i-finally-read-the-hobbit-by-jrr-tolkien/" target="_blank">The Hobbit</a>. </em><em>The Fellowship of the Ring </em>picks up with Bilbo Baggins as an old hobbit, ready to enjoy his retirement (from what exactly, I&#8217;m not sure, because he had a crap ton of money from his share of Smaug&#8217;s booty, but whatever&#8230;) Anyway. Bilbo has &#8220;adopted&#8221; Frodo Baggins as his heir. They really ARE family, but more distant than nephew and uncle. Tolkien is rather fond of the describing the genealogical origins of his characters&#8230; In great detail. (More on that later&#8230;) Bilbo and Frodo have a big birthday bash (if you recall from the movie, it&#8217;s the one Gandalf shows up for with his fancy fireworks.) Bilbo pulls a disappearing act in the middle of the party and heads off (presumably to his condo in Boca) after an intense parting with his ring. <em></em></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">In the movie, Frodo leaves home on his quest to destroy the evil ring the very next day. In the book? It takes SEVENTEEN YEARS! I&#8217;m not saying that in an &#8220;OMG that took FOREVER&#8221; sort of way. I <em>literally</em> mean it took from Frodo&#8217;s 33rd birthday to his 50th for him to get a move on. In the meantime, we learn a lot of stuff that&#8217;s not especially critical to the plot about the Shire and the cantankerous branch of the family that will inherit Bag-End once Frodo skips town. Eventually, Frodo, his eavesdropping gardener Sam, Merry, and Pippin go adventuring. Along the way they acquire a really sweet pony named Bill. I liked Bill.</p>
<div id="attachment_1731" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/billandsam.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1731" alt="Bill the Pony for President!" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/billandsam.jpg?w=660"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bill the Pony for President! (Sam and Bill are BFF.)</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">There were moments of excitement and great dialogue and serious bro-mances of the equine variety&#8230; But in order to GET to those parts, you have to wade through endless description of landscapes and geography and genealogy and songs. Have I ever mentioned that I have incredibly poor spatial skills? I can&#8217;t tell north, south, east, or west in the real world- I don&#8217;t know how I can be expected to be concerned with the debates on route between Aragorn, Boromir, and Gandalf. And the SONGS. I&#8217;ll be honest. While I was slogging through this bad boy, I would completely skip the songs. And, um, the songs in made up languages? Yeah. Not happening.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I will give Tolkien major props for excellent world building. It&#8217;s impressive for sure. I can completely understand the dedicated ravenous leagues of fans these books have acquired, and while I skip over the songs, I see why some would dissect the songs for even MORE Middle Earth goodness. I get it&#8230; I&#8217;m just not that fandom. Now, if JK Rowling published an entire book on the assorted family histories of the Harry Potter characters, gave them a fake language, and wrote volumes of verse for them, I&#8217;d be ALL ABOUT IT.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Have any of you Bookworms out there been to Middle Earth? Did you share my experience, or would you like to burn me in effigy? I&#8217;m open to both possibilities, because it&#8217;s the INTERNET and you still LOVE ME and you wouldn&#8217;t try to burn me alive for something as silly as not LOVING the <em>Lord of the Rings&#8230; </em>Right?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good Day Bookworms!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Tuesday, which can mean quite a number of things&#8230; What it means on this blog, however, is that we make LISTS. That&#8217;s right, it&#8217;s time for Top Ten Tuesday with <a href="http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">The Broke and The Bookish! </a>This week&#8217;s topic is the top ten books I read before I was a blogger. Here&#8217;s the thing. A lot of stuff I&#8217;ve blogged about, I read before I was a blogger. I learned to read when I was like 5 or 6&#8230; And I&#8217;ve only been blogging since August&#8230; That&#8217;s a whole LIFE of reading outside of the blogosphere. I&#8217;ve tried to narrow today&#8217;s list down to ten books that haven&#8217;t gotten a whole lot of attention on my blog&#8230; I feel like I&#8217;m screaming <em>Outlander </em>and <em>Gone With T</em><em>he Wind </em>and <em>Song of Achilles </em>every week, so I&#8217;m trying to feature some of the lesser known heroes of my bookshelf.</p>
<p><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/toptentuesday.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-898" alt="toptentuesday" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/toptentuesday.jpg?w=660"   /></a>1.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Stones-River-Ursula-Hegi/dp/068484477X" target="_blank"> <em>Stones From The River </em></a>by Ursula Hegi. If you liked <a title="The Book Thief by Markus Zusak: A Good Read, A Dignified Cry" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/11/26/the-book-thief-by-markus-zusak-a-good-read-a-dignified-cry/" target="_blank"><em>T</em></a><em><a title="The Book Thief by Markus Zusak: A Good Read, A Dignified Cry" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/11/26/the-book-thief-by-markus-zusak-a-good-read-a-dignified-cry/" target="_blank">he Book Thief</a>, </em>you will love <em>Stones From The River. </em>It&#8217;s about a woman named Trudi who has the bad luck to have been born a dwarf in what would become Nazi Germany. Spoiler Alert: Both books involve books, resisting the regime, and hiding Jewish people at great personal risk. It&#8217;s a fantastic read and I highly recommend it!</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fortunes-Rocks-Novel-Anita-Shreve/dp/0316678104" target="_blank"><em>Fortune&#8217;s Rocks </em></a>by Anita Shreve. Anita Shreve wrote an entire series of books set at the same beach house throughout different points in history. I don&#8217;t know if I should really call them a series, though they are all obviously entwined. The characters and situations are all so different, only the landscape ties them together. Anyway, <em>Fortune&#8217;s Rocks </em>is set in the early 1900s (I wanted to say &#8220;turn of the century&#8221; but the stupid HANDS OF TIME just keep on ticking and that phrase is no longer useful to me!) There&#8217;s a young girl, an older man, and the kind of scandal you&#8217;d expect from a young girl getting involved with an older man (who happens to be a &#8220;fine&#8221; &#8220;upstanding&#8221; married doctor with children.) This is BY FAR my favorite Anita Shreve title, so you should probably read it.</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Me-Talk-Pretty-One-Day/dp/0316776963" target="_blank"><em>Me Talk Pretty One Day </em></a>by David Sedaris. This book was given to me by one of my dearest friends (who happens to have just recently graduated from veterinary school. Can we all give Dr. Erin a big CONGRATS, Words for Worms Style?) Dr. Erin gave me this book on my 19th or 20th birthday (I cannot remember, <a title="So Far? 30 Is AWESOME!" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2013/03/29/so-far-30-is-awesome/" target="_blank">I am very, very old</a>.) Sedaris&#8217;s humor is quirky and irreverent and bizarre and wonderful. My personal copy may look a wee bit worse for the wear, but it&#8217;s one of the books I practically beat people with until they agree to read it. (That may or may not be why it&#8217;s a wee bit worse for the wear&#8230;)</p>
<div id="attachment_1726" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 232px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_0854.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1726   " alt="The Easter Bunny doesn't leave chocolate for French children. Church bells that fly in from Rome do. I know. I KNOW! " src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_0854.jpg?w=222&#038;h=297" width="222" height="297" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The Easter Bunny doesn&#8217;t leave chocolate for French children. Church bells that fly in from Rome do. I share David Sedaris&#8217;s WTF?! on that one!</p></div>
<p>4. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Gods-Wife-Amy-Tan/dp/0143038109" target="_blank"><em>The Kitchen God&#8217;s Wife </em></a>by Amy Tan. Okay, maybe I&#8217;ve discussed some of these titles before, but dangit, they&#8217;re awesome! I read this for a literature class in college and was astounded to find myself with a taste for eel and sticky rice and a host of other Chinese dishes that I&#8217;d never eaten nor cared to taste. The mark of badass prose? Making exotic food sound appealing to a girl with a bland palate. High five, Amy Tan!</p>
<p>5. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fall-Your-Knees-Oprah-45/dp/B000B86FKK" target="_blank"><em>Fall On Your Knees </em></a>by Anne Marie MacDonald. I know some of you out there shy away from anything bearing an Oprah sticker, but trust me on this one. It&#8217;s practically a Greek tragedy, except that the characters are Lebanese and Canadian. Really amazing, disturbing stuff, and it&#8217;s stuck with me for years. Side bonus? The title always gets &#8220;Oh Holy Night&#8221; stuck in my head, which is among the most beautiful Christmas carols (which has absolutely nothing to do with the content of the book, it&#8217;s just the way my brain works.)</p>
<p>6. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Speak-Laurie-Halse-Anderson/dp/0312674392" target="_blank"><em>Speak </em></a>by Laurie Halse Anderson. This is a YA title, but it deals with THE TOUGH STUFF. Basically? The main character is date raped at a party just before she starts high school. She calls the police who come to bust up the party and is treated as a pariah. Everyone knows she was the narc, but nobody knows WHY. She never reports the rape, but has to attend school with her rapist. The emotional aftermath is raw and real and frightening. It&#8217;s a great book, but if you&#8217;ve got some of your own personal demons on this subject, you may want to skip this one.</p>
<div id="attachment_1727" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 232px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_6554.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1727  " alt="Kristin Stewart starred in a movie version, but since brooding an morose is her default expression, it might not be too bad..." src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_6554.jpg?w=222&#038;h=297" width="222" height="297" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kristin Stewart starred in a movie version, but since brooding an morose is her default expression, it might not be too bad&#8230;</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">7. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Never-Let-Me-Kazuo-Ishiguro/dp/1400078776" target="_blank"><em>Never Let Me Go </em></a>by Kazuo Ishiguro. Awww yeah. Dystopia time. The premise of this book is that society has begun to breed human clones in order to harvest their organs for the greater good of the population. This novel takes you inside the lives of these clones. It&#8217;s a little bit science fiction, a little bit dystopian, and a whole lot of ethical conundrum rolled into a tasty little package.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">8. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Middlesex-Novel-Oprahs-Book-Club/dp/0312427735" target="_blank"><em>Middlesex </em></a>by Jeffrey Eugenides. This book tells the story of an intersex individual from a Greek family that immigrated to the US. Thanks to a genetic mutation, the narrator is raised believing she is a female until hormonal changes at puberty eventually lead to the discovery that she is biologically male&#8230; Sort of. It&#8217;s a fascinating look at a medical condition I was never aware of, and the impact gender can have on one&#8217;s psyche and family unit. If you can read this book without empathizing the crap out of Callie/Cal, I&#8217;m concerned about the size of your grinchy heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">9. <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Lovely-Bones-Alice-Sebold/dp/B000FDFVZ6" target="_blank">The Lovely Bones </a></em>by Alice Sebold. When Susie Salmon is brutally raped and murdered by her creepy neighbor, she continues to keep track of her family from the &#8220;other side.&#8221; Yes, this book starts out with a horrific tragedy, and it&#8217;s not easy to read. That&#8217;s really not a spoiler at all, because it&#8217;s at the very beginning of the book. The meat of this book is watching how her family deals with the tragedy. It also goes to show that the BEST murder weapon is, in fact, an icicle (which is NOT, by the way, the weapon that is used on Susie.)</p>
<div id="attachment_1728" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 248px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_1590.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1728" alt="IMG_1590" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_1590.jpg?w=238&#038;h=318" width="238" height="318" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I wasn&#8217;t a huge fan of the movie&#8230; I get grouchy when they stray too far from the book. That said, Stanley Tucci is one creepy creepster. ::Shivers::</p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">10. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Robber-Bride-Margaret-Atwood/dp/0385491034" target="_blank"><em>The Robber Bride </em></a>by Margaret Atwood. This is one of Atwood&#8217;s lesser known novels. It never gets the accolades of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blind-Assassin-Novel-Margaret-Atwood/dp/0385720955" target="_blank">The Blind Assassin</a> </em>or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Alias-Grace-Novel-Margaret-Atwood/dp/0385490445" target="_blank"><em>Alias Grace </em></a>but I thought it was fantastic. It&#8217;s about a psychopathic woman who makes it her life&#8217;s mission to destroy all of her &#8220;friends&#8217;&#8221; love lives. It taught me a great many things, not the least of which being that one can give oneself scurvy by being bulimic. As if we needed ANOTHER reason eating disorders are horrible. Now you know you can get swarthy pirate conditions. Not cute, y&#8217;all.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">So, Bookworms. I know that a lot of you aren&#8217;t bloggers, let alone book-specific bloggers, but I like to think that this top ten list is more of a memory lane sort of theme. What are some of the best books you&#8217;ve read in the not so recent past?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello My Bookworms,</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a busy weekend! I took a road trip back to my old stomping grounds to help my mom throw a baby shower for my sister. Now, I have a number of honorary nieces and nephews, and I love them all dearly. However, this will be my first go at biological Aunt-hood so it&#8217;s a pretty big deal. A couple of cool things happened (in addition to having a little visit with the one and only <a href="http://www.quirkychrissy.com/" target="_blank">Quirky Chrissy</a>.)</p>
<p>My Aunt Margie lives in Texas, which is far away from Illinois (I say this because I have no concept of the distance between Sydney and Melbourne, and some of my readers are in Australia. I&#8217;m being geographically sensitive.) She couldn&#8217;t make it to the shower. However, she mailed a gift, and I KNOW she must have been thinking of me when she picked out this bad boy:</p>
<div id="attachment_1714" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 268px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_4094.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1714   " alt="Aunt Margie will be this baby's Great Aunt. She is cool. I am obviously cool. And penguins? The coolest. " src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_4094.jpg?w=258&#038;h=346" width="258" height="346" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Aunt Margie will be this baby&#8217;s Great Aunt. She is cool. I am obviously cool. And penguins? The coolest.</p></div>
<p>That was pretty amazing. A family friend got my future nephew a penguin path toy that blows bubbles, which is fantastic. BUT! Aunt Katie got a bath toy, too! Remember me discussing <a title="Confession Friday: I Brag About Outwitting my 13 Year Old Cousin" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2013/03/08/confession-friday-in-which-i-brag-about-outwitting-my-13-year-old-cousin/" target="_blank">my punny cousin Adam</a>? Well. Being 13 he was much too cool to come to the baby shower (which I totally gave him crap for, but I&#8217;m still really nice and sent him some cake.) HOWEVER, his little sister Dana was in attendance. I have somehow convinced these children that I am cool (please don&#8217;t tell them otherwise.) Dana brought me THIS:</p>
<div id="attachment_1715" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 232px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_8598.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1715   " alt="I love this kid. Not just because she brings me presents. She's a cool kid. She also has these AMAZING freckles which are beyond adorable." src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_8598.jpg?w=222&#038;h=297" width="222" height="297" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I love this kid. Not just because she brings me presents. She&#8217;s a rocking kid. She also has these AMAZING freckles that are beyond adorable.</p></div>
<p>I am plum tuckered out. The good news is that I don&#8217;t mind road trips- road trips mean audio books! This trip&#8217;s selection was <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Curious-Incident-Dog-Night-Time/dp/1400032717" target="_blank">The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time </a></em>by Mark Haddon. I have been meaning to read this book for years and for whatever reason I hadn&#8217;t gotten around to it. I&#8217;m a little annoyed with myself that it took so long, because this book was SO GOOD!</p>
<p>Christopher Boone is a 15 year old boy. His exact diagnosis is never given, but it is clear the he has some form of Autism or Asperger&#8217;s syndrome. Christopher narrates the story. He explains in very clear language exactly how the world appears to him and why he reacts certain ways to certain situations. Christopher&#8217;s story begins one night while he&#8217;s taking an evening walk past his neighbor&#8217;s house. He discovers the neighbor&#8217;s dog, Wellington, has been murdered.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/dognighttime.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1717" alt="dognighttime" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/dognighttime.jpg?w=200&#038;h=280" width="200" height="280" /></a></p>
<p>When the neighbor discovers Christopher holding her dog&#8217;s body, she calls the police. After a difficult trip to the police station (the police officer couldn&#8217;t have known of Christopher&#8217;s violent reactions to touches) Christopher begins to fixate on solving the mystery of Wellington&#8217;s demise. It&#8217;s awfully tough to be a detective when speaking to a stranger terrifies you. When an unexpected touch can leave you on the floor covering your ears and moaning for hours to regain your composure. When seeing four yellow cars in a row can send you into an emotional tailspin.</p>
<p>At first, I was concerned that I was missing something because the audio book kept jumping around with chapters. I was concerned there were full chapters of diagrams or illustrations I was missing&#8230; However. Christopher explains a bit later that he&#8217;s chosen the chapter numbers because they are prime numbers. In order. He&#8217;s very good at &#8220;maths&#8221; (because British people make &#8220;math&#8221; plural.) I loved the sensation of being inside Christopher&#8217;s brain. The way that nuance and facial expression are foreign to him. Can you imagine how confusing it would be living in a world that just didn&#8217;t understand how your brain worked? In some ways I could relate to Christopher&#8217;s anxieties. Being in crowded public places can get under my skin, and changes in my environment have been known to rattle me. While my anxieties may be considered on the neurotic side of &#8220;normal,&#8221; poor Christopher&#8217;s reactions are far more intense. I&#8217;m going to be SO GOOD and not fill this review with spoilers, but I think you should read it. The audio book version was fantastic, I really dug the accents!</p>
<p>Tell me Bookworms, have any of you read this? What did you think?</p>

<p>The thing about writing a book blog is that if you have a slow reading week, you start running out of material. <em></em>When I was composing yesterday&#8217;s <a title="Eleanor &amp; Park: It’ll Take You Back Faster Than a Whiff of Unwashed Gym Suit." href="http://wordsforworms.com/2013/04/04/eleanor-park-itll-take-you-back-faster-than-a-whiff-of-unwashed-gym-suit/" target="_blank"><em>Eleanor &amp; Park </em></a>review, I spent a lot of time thinking about high school and the parts of it that didn&#8217;t suck. One of my FAVORITE high school pastimes was making mix tapes. I&#8217;d comb my CD collection and pick out the best tracks to put together. I liked to theme it up, you know? I&#8217;d try to impress my friends by putting &#8220;obscure&#8221; songs off of popular albums on there, so they didn&#8217;t think I only listened to the hits. I WAS DEEP, I TELL YOU! Then I&#8217;d make cover art and use crayons and stickers&#8230; Ahhh good times. So. Since I am out of books to review for the time being, I&#8217;m making y&#8217;all a little mix tape. In honor of the sweet boom box I used to make those mix tapes, I&#8217;ve created a thematic homage to books. I&#8217;m calling it &#8220;Bookish Boombox: A Mix Tape Masterpiece.&#8221; Forgive me for the lack of crayon artwork.</p>
<p><strong>Track One: &#8220;Ramble On&#8221; by Led Zeppelin.</strong> This song is based on <em>The Lord of the Rings. </em>Did you know that? I didn&#8217;t. (Thanks, Internet!) It&#8217;s one of those songs I mutter along with until the chorus. Anyway, I&#8217;m working on <em>T</em><em>he Fellowship of the Ring </em>right now, and, uh, &#8220;Ramble On?&#8221; Pretty darn appropriate, if you know what I&#8217;m saying&#8230;.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='660' height='402' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/uKVp-atyiVA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p><strong>Track Two: &#8220;Romeo &amp; Juliet&#8221; by Dire Straits.</strong> Obviously, this song goes with <em>Romeo &amp; Juliet. </em>I like to think of it as what would have become of Romeo and Juliet if they hadn&#8217;t been so impulsive and killed themselves. It&#8217;s a sad love song, and those are the best kind! This is one of my favorite, favorite songs EVER. Enjoy it!</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='660' height='402' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/mxfjSnMN88U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p><strong>Track Three: &#8220;Don&#8217;t Stand So Close To Me&#8221; by The Police.</strong> Every single time I hear this song I shout &#8220;just like the- old man in- that book by NABOKOV!&#8221; It&#8217;s about <em>Lolita, </em>obvi, and I feel that having read <em><a title="Banned Books Week: Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/10/01/banned-books-week-lolita-by-vladimir-nabokov/" target="_blank">Lolita</a>, </em>it is my right to be very smug and sing that lyric at the top of my lungs.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='660' height='402' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/KNIZofPB8ZM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p><strong>Track Four: &#8220;Yankee Bayonet&#8221; by The Decemberists.</strong> Pretty much every song by The Decemberists is a story unto itself, because they&#8217;re completely amazing. Anyway, &#8220;Yankee Bayonet&#8221; is probably my favorite Decemberists track and it&#8217;s about the civil war- from a Southern perspective, no less. Therefore, I&#8217;ve decided it totally goes with <em><a title="Gone with the Wind" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/09/26/gone-with-the-wind/" target="_blank">Gone With The Wind. </a></em>I suppose it would go better with GWTW if Scarlett had actually been in love with Charles Hamilton and he had been killed in battle <a title="Don’t They Know It’s The End of the World?" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/12/21/dont-they-know-its-the-end-of-the-world/" target="_blank">rather than by disease</a>, but whatever. It&#8217;s a good song and it&#8217;s MY MIX TAPE.</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='660' height='402' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/0qLHNXrjYlk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p><strong>Track Five: &#8220;Bloodletting (The Vampire Song)&#8221; by Concrete Blonde. </strong>Funny story about this song. My very eccentric dance teacher choreographed a tap number to this song. We wore Raggedy Ann costumes complete with yarn wigs, then threw in some fangs and capes. It was seriously creepy watching a pack of 20 adolescent girls being all evil and stuff. As if it weren&#8217;t painfully obvious, this song is about vampires, so I associate it with the <a title="Campy Vamps: My Secret Shame" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/08/15/campy-vamps-my-secret-shame/" target="_blank">Sookie Stackhouse </a>books by Charlaine Harris. It works!</p>
<p><span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='660' height='402' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/sLABwwmKdyc?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span></p>
<p>There you have it, my friends. A little literary mix tape from me to you. Are there any songs you associate with books?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sup Bookworms?!</p>
<p>I say &#8220;sup&#8221; because that was the thing to say when I was in high school. During high school,  I absolutely refused to use the term on the grounds that contractions should use apostrophes. I also wrote song lyrics out on the backs of all the notes I passed between classes and pasted magazine photo collages of grunge rockers onto my notebooks. (A 16 year old girl is a 16 year old girl, no matter her taste in music.)</p>
<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking. &#8220;Yes, Katie. We KNOW you were a cantankerous teenager. You <a title="Confession Friday: The Perks of Being A Wallflower and Katie’s Teen Angst" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/09/14/the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower/" target="_blank">wrote about it once</a>, plus, you&#8217;re a blogger. An awkward adolescence is a prerequisite, right?&#8221; I swear I have a point. The point is, I just read <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Eleanor-Park-Rainbow-Rowell/dp/1250012570" target="_blank">Eleanor &amp; Park</a> </em>by Rainbow Rowell and it took me back to high school faster than whiff of unwashed gym suit.</p>
<div id="attachment_1692" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 212px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/eandp.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1692  " alt="I listened to a discman on the bus... Because I went to high school in the 90s." src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/eandp.jpg?w=202&#038;h=304" width="202" height="304" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I listened to a discman on the bus&#8230; Because I went to high school in the 90s.</p></div>
<p>Here&#8217;s the deal. It&#8217;s 1986. Eleanor is the new girl in school. She&#8217;s on the curvy side and has wild red hair. Her first day of school, she is denied a seat on the bus by everyone (in a move of calculated cruelty that is innate to the teenage of the species) EXCEPT a half Korean kid named Park. Eleanor and Park don&#8217;t fall in love immediately. In fact, they don&#8217;t even speak. They only begin to break the ice when Park notices that Eleanor has been reading his comic books out of the corner of her eye.</p>
<p>Eleanor&#8217;s got a whole lot of crap going on in her home life. She and her 4 siblings live in squalor with their abusive stepfather and their once vibrant mother (who like many abused women has become a shell of her former self.) Eleanor is in no position to be starting a relationship, but as she and Park progress from friendship to hand holding, she knows she&#8217;s a goner.</p>
<p>THIS BOOK! It does for YA novels what <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0193676/" target="_blank">Freaks and Geeks</a> </em>did for high school on television. My high school experience was not <em>Gossip Girl </em>or <em>Friday Night Lights. </em>My high school experience was a whirlwind of awkward encounters and intense relationships that never materialized. Where hand holding could be <b>MAJOR</b>. It was so refreshing to read about an imperfect heroine who wasn&#8217;t conventionally beautiful. Sure, Eleanor has her good features, but she&#8217;s not a girl who is drop-dead-gorgeous without realizing it (cough, cough, <a title="Campy Vamps: My Secret Shame" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/08/15/campy-vamps-my-secret-shame/">Bella Swan</a>.) And Park? Park is a short Asian kid who experiments with guy-liner. I challenge you to find me another YA leading man who is 5&#8217;4. Even Harry Potter was tall!</p>
<div id="attachment_1694" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 406px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/freaks-geeks.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1694 " alt="Well, NOW they're the cool kids. Source." src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/freaks-geeks.jpg?w=396&#038;h=223" width="396" height="223" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Well, sure, NOW they&#8217;re the cool kids. <a href="http://www.curatormagazine.com/nick-olson/freaks-geeks-and-subverting-the-politics-of-fashion/" target="_blank">Source</a>.</p></div>
<p>No, I didn&#8217;t listen to The Cure on my walkman on the bus, mostly because I didn&#8217;t go to high school in 1986. (I listened to The Counting Crows on my discman. Very skippy, the discman.) Even though my gym suit was definitely less horrifying than Eleanor&#8217;s polyester onesie, I dreaded gym class. My junior year, I was hit in the head with EVERY SINGLE BALL we used. I only wish I were exaggerating. I was beaned with a soccer ball, basketball, volleyball, hockey puck, tennis ball, football, softball, and the absolute pinnacle of my humiliation? Badminton birdie. I wasn&#8217;t subject to intense bullying (although I still do not have good thoughts about that girl with the slicked back ponytail and sinister eyeliner who always laughed at magnetic melon&#8230;) I didn&#8217;t have a messy home life either, but this book isn&#8217;t about winning the screwed up teen experience award. This book is about capturing the essence of being 16. It&#8217;s about first love and identity crises and confusion and the occasional glimmer greatness beneath the awkward.</p>
<p>I chewed through this book in two days and had to let it marinate in my brain juices before I could form coherent thoughts. Katie + <em>Eleanor &amp; Park </em>= Love. The soundtracks may change, but high school will always be the same. Rainbow Rowell gets that, and for that, I salute her. (Insert well timed slow clap.)</p>
<p>Alright bookworms. Please tell me I&#8217;m not alone here. Let&#8217;s take this opportunity to share our most horrifying gym class experiences. It&#8217;ll be like group therapy. Ready? Go!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey There Bookworms,</p>
<p>Before I get into today&#8217;s Top Ten Tuesday list, I want to take a moment to give a shout-out to the Hubs. That&#8217;s right, today Jim turns 31. Happy Birthday! The thing that makes this birthday extra super special is that it is ALSO the anniversary of our first date. The TENTH anniversary. (For a first date that took place on a 21st birthday, it was shockingly wholesome.) Yay, Jim! Happy Birth-iversary! I totally still have a crush on you.</p>
<div id="attachment_1684" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 380px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_3818.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1684  " alt="First photo of us as a couple, a mere 10 days after that first date. Which reminds me... Happy Almost Anniversary to Meresa and Scott! (Yeah. He went to a wedding with me after a week and a half. Keeper.)" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_3818.jpg?w=370&#038;h=275" width="370" height="275" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">First photo of us as a couple, a mere 10 days after that first date. Which reminds me&#8230; Happy Almost Anniversary to Meresa and Scott! (Yeah. He went to a wedding with me after a week and a half of dating. Keeper.)</p></div>
<p>You know what the best part about a stable relationship is? Jim&#8217;s not even a tiny bit threatened by the fact that I&#8217;ve got crushes on other boys. Sure, it helps that all the boys are fictional characters&#8230; Like any bookworm, I have an active imagination. Since <a href="http://brokeandbookish.blogspot.com/p/top-ten-tuesday-other-features.html" target="_blank">The Broke and The Bookish </a>asked so nicely, today I shall list my Top Ten Fictional Character Crushes.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ttt3w.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-827 aligncenter" alt="TTT3W" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ttt3w.jpeg?w=660"   /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">1. <strong>Fred and/or George Weasley</strong>. So, here&#8217;s the thing. I hate to admit to this, but, I didn&#8217;t read <em>Harry Potter </em><em></em>until after the first movie came out. This means, among other things, that my mental images of characters were tainted going into the series. I LOVE the Weasley twins, and the movie twins are pretty cute. I know they&#8217;re shorter and rounder in the books, but they&#8217;re so funny and awesome. Laughter is a big deal to me, and I&#8217;m pretty sure a Weasley twin would keep me in stitches. (Maybe not as well as Jim, though. His sense of humor is incredibly absurd and he frequently makes me laugh until my tummy hurts.)</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">2. <strong>Jamie Fraser.</strong> I know, I know. I rave about <em>Outlander </em>constantly, but SWOON, Jamie! He&#8217;s strong and smart and he speaks lots of languages and he looks hot in a kilt. Plus, he&#8217;s so head over heels for Claire, it&#8217;s redonk. I mean, really.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">3. <strong>Jon Snow.</strong> <em></em>The new season of <em>Game of Thrones </em>started up the other night. I watched season 1, but for whatever reason I fell off the wagon after that. I&#8217;m considering jumping back on. I mean, I&#8217;ve read all the books, you know? And. JON SNOW. Ned Stark&#8217;s bastard child is one hot piece of ice, if you know what I&#8217;m saying. Really though. I love book Jon. I love TV Jon. Long live Jon Snow!<em></em></p>
<div id="attachment_1685" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 406px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/jonsnow.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1685 " alt="Celibacy on The Wall? What a waste! Source." src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/jonsnow.jpg?w=396&#038;h=223" width="396" height="223" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Celibacy on The Wall? What a waste! <a href="http://forums.allkpop.com/threads/vorisy56.166025/" target="_blank">Source.</a></p></div>
<p style="text-align:left;">4. <strong>Mr. Darcy.</strong><em></em> <em></em>Oh yeah, I just pulled out the old <em>Pride and Prejudice </em>card. How could I not? I mean, he&#8217;s MR. DARCY. Proud. Prejudiced. Secretly in love with the feisty Elizabeth Bennett. Be still my heart!</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">5. <strong>Gus. </strong>You remember, the dreamboat cancer patient from <em><a title="The Fault In Our Stars (Is That We Haven’t Enough Tissues) by John Green" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2013/01/02/the-fault-in-our-stars-is-that-we-havent-enough-tissues-by-john-green/" target="_blank">The Fault In Our Stars</a>? </em>Sure, he didn&#8217;t speak the way any REAL teenager would. He was far too smart and witty and self assured. But. That&#8217;s what <em>Tiger Beat </em>dreams are made of.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">6. <strong>Charlie.</strong> Yep. My teenage self had a big old crush on Charlie from <em><a title="Confession Friday: The Perks of Being A Wallflower and Katie’s Teen Angst" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/09/14/the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower/" target="_blank">The Perks of Being a Wallflower</a>. </em>I loved his brilliant socially stunted antics. And his wounded puppy psyche. Sigh.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">7. <strong>Marius</strong> <strong>Pontmercy. <em></em></strong>I think every girl on the planet imagines that she&#8217;s Eponine when they listen to <em></em>&#8220;On My Own<em>.&#8221; </em>Who among us has never tasted the bitter pill of unrequited love?! <em><a title="Do You Hear The People Sing? (Give Them ALL THE OSCARS!)" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/12/30/do-you-hear-the-people-sing-give-them-all-the-oscars/" target="_blank">Les Miserables</a> </em>the book gives Marius a much juicier backstory than the musical. It certainly doesn&#8217;t hurt Marius&#8217;s swoonworthiness that Eddie Redmayne played the part in the movie&#8230;</p>

<p>8. <strong>Stu Redman. </strong>Why yes, I DO have a thing for the no-nonsense leader of the &#8220;good-guy&#8221; pack from <em><a title="The Stand by Stephen King… Or Katie vs. Taylor Swift" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2012/10/18/the-stand-by-stephen-king-or-katie-vs-taylor-swift/" target="_blank">The Stand</a>. </em>He is immune to the super flu, plus he&#8217;s got a cowboy vibe. I don&#8217;t know, maybe I was swayed by the fact that Lieutenant Dan played him in the mini series. The heart wants what the heart wants!</p>
<p>9. <strong>Roger MacKenzie.</strong> <em></em><em></em>Yeah. He&#8217;s from <em>Outlander </em>too. Roger is one dishy time traveler. Green eyed, Scottish accented, folk song crooning, tall drink of water. Mmmmhmmm.</p>
<p>10. <em></em><strong>Jim.</strong> Yes, I am cheating and making my husband into a fictional character. Public display of affection, blog style. Oh. Fictional Jim may or may not also be Batman. Or just own tasteful Batman statues. XOXO.</p>
<p>Bookworms, tell me. Who are your bookish fictional character crushes? We&#8217;re equal opportunity here. Dudes, ladies, whatever floats your boat. Share the lurve!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Howdy Bookworms,</p>
<p>I hope those of you who celebrate Easter have recovered from your chocolate bunny and jelly bean comas on this fine morning. It&#8217;s April Fool&#8217;s Day, but I&#8217;m not a fan of the holiday. I am a terrible liar, and I&#8217;m also embarrassingly gullible. Not a good combination. Plus, pranks have a way of turning mean, and I&#8217;m not a fan of meanness either. So. Let&#8217;s talk about&#8230; A book! (I know, you&#8217;re shocked!)</p>
<p>This month for Wine and Whining Book Club (I consistently get crap from the book club&#8217;s membership for what I&#8217;ve named it, but I like homonyms and alliterations, so I shan&#8217;t be changing it) we selected <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shoemakers-Wife-Novel-Adriana-Trigiani/dp/0061257109" target="_blank">The Shoemaker&#8217;s Wife</a> </em>by Adriana Trigiani. <em>The Shoemaker&#8217;s Wife </em>is the tale of an unlikely couple re-united from their small Italian mountain town in New York City.</p>
<div id="attachment_1677" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 229px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/theshoemakers-wife.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1677 " alt="I'm really not sure who the broad on the cover is..." src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/theshoemakers-wife.jpg?w=219&#038;h=333" width="219" height="333" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I&#8217;m really not sure who the broad on the cover is&#8230;</p></div>
<p>Circumstances conspire to send the (for all intents and purposes) orphaned Ciro away from his home in a convent the Italian Alps to become an apprentice shoemaker in America. Unfortunately, his exit from town is untimely as he is separated from his new found lady love, Enza. Shortly after Ciro&#8217;s departure, Enza and her family fall on hard times and she and her father make the decision to emigrate to America as well. Their emigration takes place during the early 1910s, so their journey reads like the quintessential Ellis Island tale.</p>
<p>Ciro and Enza&#8217;s path to finding each other again is not an easy one. They both have their share of adventures. Enza is a talented seamstress but stuck in Hoboken in a Cinderella-esque situation. Ciro is distracted by a high maintenance local beauty and turns out to be a kick ass boot maker. Their trials and tribulations give you a great picture of the times in which they live, and they talk enough about pasta to make you hungry.</p>
<p>Spoilers are the bane of my existence, because it&#8217;s so difficult to talk about books without giving EVERYTHING away. I will say this much&#8230; While I enjoyed this book overall, there was a critical scene that reminded me a LOT of a scene in another one of Trigiani&#8217;s books, <em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60057.Lucia_Lucia" target="_blank">Lucia, Lucia</a>. </em>Consider this your SPOILER ALERT. Now. The goings on of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460649/" target="_blank"><em>How I Met Your Mother </em></a>aside, people being ditched at the altar is NOT a common thing. Things rarely get to the point of tuxedos and gowns being donned when weddings fall apart. The fact that this occurred in both of the Trigiani books disappoints me, I mean, calling off a wedding a couple months ahead of time is infinitely more realistic. It&#8217;s certainly more dramatic to pull the jilted at the altar routine, but it&#8217;s almost too easy&#8230; That&#8217;s probably an unfair assessment, but I&#8217;m a giant snob-a-saurus rex.</p>
<p>Safe to read again. If this is your first Trigiani novel, and you like historical fiction, you&#8217;ll love it! So, Bookworms, are you ever frustrated by authors recycling story lines? Getting repetitive? Anybody else run into that?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dearly Beloved,</p>
<p>We are gathered here today so I can make my case for being the Florist/Flower Girl for the online wedding of <a href="http://psychobabblepants.wordpress.com/2013/03/07/youre-invited-to-an-online-wedding/" target="_blank">Lyssa of Psychobabble and Shirtless Ryan Gosling</a>. I used to work in a flower shop, and while they only let me wash buckets and answer phones, I&#8217;m TOTALLY QUALIFIED to be an online wedding florist.</p>
<p>People always assume that all little girls get the opportunity to be a flower girl at some point in their lives. I&#8217;m here to tell you that THEY ARE WRONG. I was never a flower girl. It&#8217;s a travesty. Feast your eyes on 5-year-old me:</p>
<div id="attachment_1633" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 204px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_6728-e1363916693322.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1633   " alt="I was effing ADORABLE!" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_6728-e1363916693322.jpg?w=194&#038;h=260" width="194" height="260" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I was effing ADORABLE!</p></div>
<p>Obviously I&#8217;m not over this slight. I need this for my mental health and well being, damnit! Let&#8217;s begin. Lyssa and Ryan have chosen to have a jungle theme for their botanical elements. This is incredibly lucky, because what I really want to portray in this wedding is RAMPANT FECUNDITY. When couples marry, they are encouraged by society to, in the immortal words of Ross from <em>Friends, </em>&#8220;consummate like bunnies.&#8221; With this in mind, I have chosen antherium for Lyssa&#8217;s bouquet with an orchid boutonierre for Ryan.</p>
<div id="attachment_1668" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 169px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/antherium-bouq.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1668 " alt="Antherium are exceptionally phallic." src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/antherium-bouq.jpg?w=159&#038;h=252" width="159" height="252" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Antherium are exceptionally phallic. Oh, yes, <a href="http://notthehardestpart.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Emily? Maid of Honor</a>? You&#8217;ll be required to fan Lyssa with the bouquet once she passes it off to you.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_1669" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 269px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/orchid.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1669 " alt="And. Well. Orchids are pretty darn suggestive. " src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/orchid.jpg?w=259&#038;h=173" width="259" height="173" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">And. Well. Orchids are pretty darn suggestive.</p></div>
<p>In addition to the pornographic florals, I&#8217;ve decided to create an extra feature that will not only compliment the theme, but also protect the wedding party from Zombie attack. That&#8217;s right. The perimeter of the venue will be surrounded by tiger pits! I will have trenches dug, much in the way one would dig a moat. However, a moat would be USELESS because Zombies DON&#8217;T BREATHE and are therefore impervious to water barriers. The pits will be filled with bamboo spikes! Bamboo is the epitome of jungle-ness, and it&#8217;s also really sharp. Those spears will impale any marauding herds of the undead while allowing the guests to party unscathed. (There will be retractable walkways so no guests are accidentally impaled&#8230; Unless you get REALLY mad at your drunk uncle&#8230;)</p>
<p>Instead of tossing rice or blowing bubbles for Lyssa and Ryan&#8217;s grand exit, the guests will instead line up and create an archway for the couple to walk through with their party favors. You guessed it! The party favors are MACHETES! A necessity in both the jungle and the Zombie Apocalypse. I can guarantee there&#8217;s not a mason jar project on Pinterest that can compete with a freaking machete.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not JUST the florist, remember? I&#8217;m also the flower girl, because the universe conspired against me and WASTED my childhood cuteness on ballet lessons. Ugh. Anyway. I&#8217;ve chosen the most SPECTACULAR dress, that fits the jungle theme perfectly:</p>
<div id="attachment_1670" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 193px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/katieflowergirl.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-1670 " alt="The word you're looking for is &quot;glorious.&quot;" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/katieflowergirl.jpg?w=660"   /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">The word you&#8217;re looking for is &#8220;glorious.&#8221; You&#8217;re also REALLY impressed with my sexy photoshop skills.</p></div>
<p>I implore you, dear readers, please leave a comment to let Lyssa know that I&#8217;m the right choice for all her flower needs! I&#8217;m a whirling dervish of flowers, tulle, and general bad-assery. Help me achieve my dreams!</p>
<div id="attachment_1671" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 386px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/lyssapants.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1671 " alt="This needs to happen. NEEDS TO!" src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/lyssapants.jpg?w=376&#038;h=359" width="376" height="359" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">This needs to happen. NEEDS TO!</p></div>
<p>Now, Shirtless Ryan Gosling, you may kiss the Flower Girl. Wait, I mean&#8230; No. I meant that. I really did.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome Bookworms, Old and New!</p>
<p>Remember last week how I was <a title="My Birthday, Your Presents" href="http://wordsforworms.com/2013/03/22/1632/" target="_blank">freaking out about turning 30</a>? So far, 30 has been kind of awesome. But. First things first. We have a WINNER of the $30 Amazon gift card. Thanks to EVERYONE for your tweets and likes and whatnot. I tallied up the entries and plugged them into a random number generator. The WINNER is&#8230; Jen Hartling! Jen is not only a dedicated bookworm, she also writes her own CERTIFIED AWESOME book blog, The <a href="http://therelentlessreader.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Relentless Reader</a>. May the odds be <em>ever </em>in your favor!</p>
<p>Why is 30 rocking my world? LET ME TELL YOU! I took my birthday off of work and my husband took me to the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago. He earned himself INFINITY brownie points by taking me to MEET A PENGUIN. Not only did he set me up with a penguin encounter (which is a thing they offer&#8230; Click <a href="http://www.sheddaquarium.org/premium_experiences.html" target="_blank">HERE</a> if you&#8217;re interested) but he arranged it so that we were the only two people in the penguin encounter. They&#8217;re typically done in groups of ten, but Jim in all his weasel-y wisdom managed to get us a private meet and greet with penguin #413. (I am certain he spent too much money doing this, but I had THE BEST TIME so I can&#8217;t be upset.)</p>
<div id="attachment_1661" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 327px"><a href="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_0201.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-1661  " alt="Can you tell I was REALLY excited?! " src="http://wordsforworms.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_0201.jpg?w=317&#038;h=236" width="317" height="236" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Can you tell I was REALLY excited?!</p></div>
<p>The penguins at the Shedd are identified by number, they don&#8217;t have individual names (I KNOW!) In my head, Penguin #413 was Josie. Josie was super friendly and curious. She pooped twice, she pecked at my jeans, and she stepped on my galoshes several times. Sometimes she would take a deep breath and puff herself up like a penguin balloon. The trainer claimed Josie was re-setting her feathers, but I think she was just showing off her deep breathing abilities. Also, did you know penguins can sneeze? Yeah. They totally can. She has little nostril thingies on her beak that get clogged with salt from the water and the fishes, so she &#8220;sneezes&#8221; to clear them. AND! They don&#8217;t even have to monitor what they feed the penguins. Josie and her Magellenic counterparts are perfect self regulators. They fatten up temporarily during molting season, but that&#8217;s it. When the trainer offered her fish she didn&#8217;t want, she just shook her little head. Amazing.</p>

<p>I got to pet Josie on her back (which felt a lot like beagle fur- soft yet oily) AND her flipper (which felt very rubbery.) Jim got to pet Josie on the foot (which was speckled and thus impossibly adorable) and the belly.</p>

<p>Yeah, so my decade is really starting on an upswing. But that isn&#8217;t all. I was FRESHLY PRESSED this week. It&#8217;s an enormous honor and I can hardly believe the powers that be at WordPress noticed my little corner of weird, but I&#8217;m beyond thrilled by it. THRILLED, I tell you! I think 30 and I are going to get along just fine. (As long as I keep getting carded at the liquor store.)</p>
