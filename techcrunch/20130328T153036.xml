<p>It&#8217;s not as compact as an Aeropress, but the Nomad looks like a solid way to get an espresso shot from a small device. The tiny machine, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/uniterra-nomad/nomadtm-the-go-everywhere-espresso-machinetm">which is currently on Kickstarter</a>, boasts the same principles used in full-sized espresso machines. The Nomad is just a lot smaller, more efficient, and doesn&#8217;t require any power making it rather portable &#8212; hence the name.</p>
<p>The company is looking for $100,000 on Kickstarter. Pledge $165 to pre-order a Nomad. It&#8217;s available in black and green. I&#8217;m in for one.</p>
<p>As the videos show here, the shots seem smooth and proper. By using pressure from dual micro chambers, the Nomad can apparently achieve the same results as a full-size lever espresso machine.</p>
<p>To me the Nomad doesn&#8217;t seem all the portable but rather movable. I doubt I would throw this in a backpack like I do with my Aeropress, but it seems perfect for a roadtrip. If the small Nomad can make a fine shot of espresso, which it seemingly can, it could quickly become a must-have for small kitchens and the like.</p>

		<title>In-App Purchase Revenue Hits Record High: Accounts For 76% Of U.S. iPhone App Revenue, 90% In Asian Markets</title>

Last January, just over half (53 percent) of iPhone App Store revenue in the U.S. was attributed to in-app purchases, but as of last month, that number has climbed to a record 76 percent. The figure varies by region, however. In Germany, for example, it&#8217;s lower &#8211; only 61 percent of revenue in February came from these in-app sales. Meanwhile, in Asian markets the number soars. In Hong Kong, Japan, China and South Korea, at least 90 percent of all revenue comes from in-app purchases. These findings are revealed in the latest report from app store analytics firm Distimo, which took a deep dive into the data in this month&#8217;s report. In particular, the report examines trends here in the U.S., looking at the business models chosen by app publishers who are using in-app purchases in their mobile applications on the iPhone. Not surprisingly, Distimo found that the majority (71 percent) of apps were &#8220;freemium&#8221; applications, meaning that the app itself was free, but other features, virtual goods, extra levels, services, upgrades, and more are available for sale once the app is on the iPhone. Another 5 percent of apps using in-app purchases were paid applications, and around a quarter (24 percent) of iPhone apps in the U.S. were paid applications only, without in-app purchases involved. In a crowded App Store where there are now some 800,000+ iOS applications to choose from, developers find it more difficult than ever to have their apps discovered, much less installed. Putting a price tag on the app itself is something that&#8217;s seen as a barrier to entry for curious or casual users, especially given that Apple&#8217;s App Store has yet to implement a &#8220;try before you buy&#8221; option, similar to what Google&#8217;s Android app marketplace, Google Play, offers through easy-to-access refunds and subscription content trials, for instance. App developers competing for precious homescreen space have clearly been cornered into adopting this business model, even though at times (and certainly in children&#8217;s applications) it can almost come across as disingenuous, or even shady, when not properly advertised. And the move towards more freemium, in-app purchase based (IAP) apps is still occurring.

<p>These findings are revealed in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.distimo.com/report/download-latest">the latest report from app store analytics firm Distimo</a>, which took a deep dive into the data in this month&#8217;s report. In particular, the report examines trends here in the U.S., looking at the business models chosen by app publishers who are using in-app purchases in their mobile applications on the iPhone.</p>

Another 5 percent of apps using in-app purchases were paid applications, and around a quarter (24 percent) of iPhone apps in the U.S. were paid applications only, without in-app purchases involved.</p>
<p>In a crowded App Store where there are now some 800,000+ iOS applications to choose from, developers find it more difficult than ever to have their apps discovered, much less installed. Putting a price tag on the app itself is something that&#8217;s seen as a barrier to entry for curious or casual users, especially given that Apple&#8217;s App Store has yet to implement a &#8220;try before you buy&#8221; option, similar to what Google&#8217;s Android app marketplace, Google Play, offers through <a target="_blank" href="http://support.google.com/googleplay/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=134336">easy-to-access refunds</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://developer.android.com/google/play/billing/billing_subscriptions.html#trials">subscription content trials</a>, for instance. App developers competing for precious homescreen space have clearly been cornered into adopting this business model, even though at times (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/04/apples-ipad-needs-a-kid-mode-like-yesterday/">and certainly in children&#8217;s applications</a>) it can almost come across as disingenuous, or even shady, when not properly advertised.</p>
<p>And the move towards more freemium, in-app purchase based (IAP) apps is still occurring. As noted above, more apps are generating revenue through this method than just a year ago.  Looking at the top grossing apps from February 2013, which were released since January 2012, <em>all</em> were freemium applications.</p>
<p>Distimo also examined the top 250 grossing applications last month, again those released since last January, and estimated downloads and revenue to determine the app store metric known as ARPD, or &#8220;average revenue per download.&#8221; The resulting range of ARPD&#8217;s here shows that though the business model overall is the one publishers are gravitating towards, how well it&#8217;s working on a per download basis varies wildly. ARPDs in the top 10 went from as low as $0.37 to as high as $7.04.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/in-app-purchase-revenue-hits-record-high-accounts-for-76-of-u-s-iphone-app-revenue-90-in-asian-markets/top-grossing-apps/" rel="attachment wp-att-787412"></a></p>
<p>To determine which business model worked best overall, Distimo then looked at the top 250 grossing applications, where 170 were free with IAP, 53 were paid with IAP and 27 were paid only. (Apps which changed business models were discarded from the analysis. Ad revenues were not counted, either.) The average ARPD for all the iPhone apps is $0.99, says Distimo.</p>
<p>For all paid apps, it&#8217;s $2.25 and for free apps, it&#8217;s $0.93. Among just those using IAP, paid apps&#8217; ARPD was $2.46.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/in-app-purchase-revenue-hits-record-high-accounts-for-76-of-u-s-iphone-app-revenue-90-in-asian-markets/arpd-iphone-us/" rel="attachment wp-att-787415"></a></p>
<p>While the above focuses on the iPhone App Store, Distimo also dug into the iPad App Store to see similar trends. Here, average selling prices tend to be higher. In fact, the average price across the whole store is $4.46 versus $3.19 for iPhone, as of February 2013.</p>
<p>For paid apps without IAP, the ARPD is $4.04 &#8211; almost two times higher than on iPhone. For paid apps with IAP, it&#8217;s $3.72. Freemium apps were at $2.26, also higher than on iPhone.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/28/in-app-purchase-revenue-hits-record-high-accounts-for-76-of-u-s-iphone-app-revenue-90-in-asian-markets/arpd-ipad-us/" rel="attachment wp-att-787417"></a></p>
<p>Overall, Distimo concluded that the average in-app revenue per download from paid apps is $0.98 on iPhone versus $1.26 on iPad.</p>
<p>The report then turned to non-U.S. trends, showing how Japan in particular has a high ARPD. Among the top 10 grossing iPhone apps in that country, the average ARPD is over $12. Distimo notes that it pulled &#8220;Puzzles &amp; Dragons&#8221; from this analysis to prevent bias towards this game only; had it been included, the ARPD would be even higher.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/screen-shot-2013-03-28-at-14-44-10.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="zaptravel" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p><a target="_blank" href="http://tapulous.com">Tapulous</a>, one of the earliest, big mobile games makers for the iPhone, made its splash with <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_Tap_Revenge">Tap Tap Revenge</a>, the first in a series of apps where users tapped on dropping balls in time with music &#8212; a formula that proved wildly successful and eventually resulted in the company getting bought by Disney in 2010 for <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/02/the-tapulous-purchase-price-mystery/">reportedly $50 million</a>. Now, one of the co-founders of Tapulous, the Australian Andrew Lacy, has hotfooted it to Paris to tackle something new: the online travel market, with the launch of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zaptravel.com/">ZapTravel</a>, a semantic travel search engine.</p>
<p>The idea of ZapTravel is to do away with the need for all the extra &#8220;data entry&#8221; required by many travel sites today, from selecting calendar dates to entering destinations from pop-up menus and more. ZapTravel searches are based on what you type into a single window, with details &#8220;human&#8221; as what you&#8217;d type to a friend. For example, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to go to Stockholm.&#8221;</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you register, ZapTravel makes note of your location, so all searches are by default from there. You can also set other defaults around, say, how fancy/budget you&#8217;d like your accomodation to be. ZapTravel then creates discounted trips based on the information you have provided, offering flights and hotel options. It&#8217;s working with some 3,000 partners now to create those deals. With the longer-term emphasis on experiences as much as getting you from point A to B, it looks like the plan is to present more packages in the longer run (not just directing you to a cool city for food, but suggesting and booking a table at a top restaurant).</p>
<p></p>
<p>In that sense, ZapTravel is also trying to cater to users who are undecided about where they would like to go. Lacy says that since ZapTravel&#8217;s soft launch last week, one of the most popular search terms (go Internet go!) has been &#8220;sex,&#8221; to which ZapTravel&#8217;s engine &#8220;diligently returns dynamically constructed deals for nightlife destinations and places with lively atmosphere.&#8221; It also includes city guides, created by aggregating content from other sites like Frommers and locals enlisted by ZapTravel.</p>
<p>Lacy &#8212; who is a lawyer and MBA by training but coded half the site &#8212; describes ZapTravel as &#8220;a learning system.&#8221; He says that there is an ongoing mix of algorithmic processing, along with some human shaping. The platform&#8217;s &#8220;vocabulary&#8221; already has &#8220;3,000 destinations, 10,000 different reasons to go, and 15,000 events&#8221; to trigger search results, says Lacy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more people use it and the more content we feed it, the better it is able to put together packages to match specific interests,&#8221; he says. Others on ZapTravel&#8217;s team include engineer Nicolas Martignole, who organizes the French Java conference Devoxx France, and used to build complex financial systems for Reuters; user experience specialist Olivier Desmoulins; and Mathieu Seguin. There is also a separate office for development in Eastern Europe, says Lacy.</p>
<h4>Where games end and travel begins</h4>
<p>ZapTravel and Tapulous couldn&#8217;t be more different &#8212; one mobile-first and created for pure entertainment, and the other launching first on desktop and focused on e-commerce and using new technology around semantic search to help complete travel transactions; one based in Palo Alto and the other anchored in Paris &#8220;because Europe is a much bigger market for travel in general.&#8221; But there are some threads between the two. In addition to the entrepreneur himself, there is the fact that both are trying to create markets for products that have yet to be established.</p>
<p>In the case of Tapulous, it was making iPhone apps before Apple had even officially moved into the space itself. ZapTravel, meanwhile, is hoping to establish itself as a semantic travel platform at a time when the playing field is still wide open.</p>
<p>But that is changing.</p>
<p>For one, services like Siri on the iPhone and Google Now on Android offer users quicker, less labor intensive ways of discovering new information; and that is whetting people&#8217;s appetite to have easier user experience everywhere. In addition, the ever-growing number of online travel options &#8212; why book an expensive, touristy hotel on Travelocity if you can stay in a cute loft with Airbnb? &#8212; will mean that those sites that make it easier to give you the right information stand to win your business.</p>
<p>On top of that, there has been some significant M&amp;A in the space as the bigger players in online travel look to expand their features more to compete against others, with huge deals like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/08/priceline-com-acquires-kayak-for-1-8-billion/">Priceline&#8217;s acquisition of Kayak</a> for $1.8 billion, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/21/expedia-buys-majority-stake-in-european-hotel-search-site-trivago-for-632-million/">Expedia&#8217;s majority stake in Trivago</a> for $632 million, and also smaller startup plays like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/22/travel-site-tripadvisor-buys-tinypost-to-fill-out-its-mobile-and-social-ambitions/">Tripadvisor buying Tiny Post</a> last week.</p>
<p>Would-be competitors include <a target="_blank" href="http://www.expedia.com">Expedia</a>, which is beta-testing a semantic search called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yourvisit.com/">YourVisit</a>; and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cheapair.com/">CheapAir</a>, which is beta-testing &#8220;Easy Search&#8221; for semantic searches of flights. Among startups, there is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/08/sri-desti-launch/">Desti</a>, the &#8220;personal travel assistant&#8221; spun out from Siri-creators Sri International. And <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hopper.com/">Hopper</a>, staffed up by a team that left Expedia that has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/hopper">raised $22 million</a> for what also appears to be a semantic search app, but it is still in stealth mode.</p>
<p>ZapTravel will be trying to meet the market and exceed what others are already doing.</p>
<p>&#8220;The travel industry has a lot of poor quality experiences,&#8221; says Lacy. &#8220;I learned how to make beautiful products at Tapulous and that’s what i’m trying to do here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says that plans for the mobile app will include the ability to enter search requests by voice as well as text. One area I&#8217;ve seen that will need room for improvement is its ability to deal with people who make typos (like me). This too is being worked on, says Lacy.</p>
<p>ZapTravel is currently bootstrapped but is in the process of raising an Angel round that it expects to close in the next few months.</p>

A confidential presentation that describes a Shenzhen-based manufacturer's 2013 product plans points to a few interesting bits of information about the iPhone 5S launch in June 2013 and <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/Foxconn">Foxconn's</a> role as manufacturer of record for <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/apple">Apple</a> products.

<p>The presentation catalog, which details new cases and chargers for iPhone devices as well as Qi-enabled wireless chargers and dongles for the iPhone 5, points to a firm June 2013 launch of what they are calling the iPhone 5S. Leaks like this are obviously par for the course when it comes to Shenzhen manufacturers &#8211; they usually follow the same rumors we do &#8211; but this manufacturer has an interesting inside track to Foxconn, promising &#8220;synchronization&#8221; with the Apple release in June.</p>
<p>The company also boasts complete Apple certification and is working with Foxconn directly to launch product immediately upon the launch of the new devices. This sort of leak &#8211; a launch date, direct contact to a certified manufacturer, and mention of direct cooperation with <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/Foxconn">Foxconn</a> &#8211; is fairly unique in the world of Apple news.</p>
<p>This information could be a bit of careless boasting but it does suggest a certain level of certainty in the market and reinforces rumors of a June iPhone 5S release. It also suggests a certain lack of fear in manufacturers as they approach a new, post-Steve Jobs Apple. Whether the information is accurate is impossible to tell &#8211; yet. However, it is some of the most convincing data we&#8217;ve seen relating to new Apple launches.</p>

		<title>Brooklyn Band Ghost Beach Launches Ad Campaign That Encourages Fans To Pick A Side On Piracy</title>

Piracy is freedom. Piracy is harmless. Piracy is inevitable. Piracy is robbery. Piracy is evil. Piracy is selfish. Or is it a fad? It’s part of an advertising campaign by a Brooklyn-based band called Ghost Beach that is asking all of us to choose a side: are you for piracy, or are you against it? The billboard directs the public to its Artists vs. Artists website, where you can choose to either buy Ghost Beach’s new album on iTunes, or simply download the entire album for free. The website also asks you to tweet where your true allegiance lies with the hashtags #artistsagainstpiracy and #artistsforpiracy. Tweets that have gone out in support of piracy outnumber the latter by a factor of 20 to 1. The purpose behind this experiment, reminiscent of when Radiohead gave their fans the option of downloading their album In Rainbows for any sum of money they wanted on their website, is to alert the music industry on what the public ultimately wants. “By giving music listeners the choice to buy, stream or download free from the artist,” band frontman Josh Ocean tells TorrentFreak, “everybody wins and music is shared in a way that is convenient for listeners and respects the artists intellectual property.” The band doesn’t support piracy by any means, but hopes that the music industry will realize that piracy will remain a more convincing option until fans are given more “modern choices” when it comes to the consumption of music. For now, it seems as though a majority of their fans think that “modern choices” equates to free. Still, a conundrum remains. The big record labels won&#8217;t budge a bit on their current pricing models as long as piracy continues. No amount of online piracy will convince the record labels to bring prices down. What consumers need to do, if they feel as if they&#8217;re being robbed by the record labels, is to embrace the new forms of music consumption that are out there. Music streaming services like Spotify, Pandora, and to a lesser extent Rdio are doing well because of the freemium model they&#8217;ve employed. On these services, you can legally listen to as much music as you&#8217;d like as long as you don&#8217;t mind ads, and if you want ads gone, all]]></description>

<p>“By giving music listeners the choice to buy, stream or download free from the artist,” band frontman Josh Ocean tells <a target="_blank" href="http://http://torrentfreak.com/piracy-is-progress-billboard-on-times-square-divides-artists-130327/">TorrentFreak</a>, “everybody wins and music is shared in a way that is convenient for listeners and respects the artists intellectual property.”</p>
<p>The band doesn’t support piracy by any means, but hopes that the music industry will realize that piracy will remain a more convincing option until fans are given more “modern choices” when it comes to the consumption of music. For now, it seems as though a majority of their fans think that “modern choices” equates to free.</p>
<p>Still, a conundrum remains. The big record labels won&#8217;t budge a bit on their current pricing models as long as piracy continues. No amount of online piracy will convince the record labels to bring prices down. What consumers need to do, if they feel as if they&#8217;re being robbed by the record labels, is to embrace the new forms of music consumption that are out there.</p>
<p>Music streaming services like <a target="_blank" href="http://http://www.crunchbase.com/company/spotify">Spotify</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://http://www.crunchbase.com/company/pandora">Pandora</a>, and to a lesser extent <a target="_blank" href="http://http://www.crunchbase.com/company/rdio">Rdio</a> are doing well because of the freemium model they&#8217;ve employed. On these services, you can legally listen to as much music as you&#8217;d like as long as you don&#8217;t mind ads, and if you want ads gone, all you have to do is pay a small monthly premium.</p>
<p>Of course, now it’s time for you to take a side. Click <a target="_blank" href="http://http://www.artistsvsartists.com/">here</a> to be taken to the band’s Artists vs. Artists website and make your allegiance known.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s often been assumed that teens are one of the main culprits in the texting-while-driving epidemic in the U.S. It makes sense &mdash; teens are new drivers, and thus more reckless, and they also happen to be expert texters. </p>
<p>However, a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freep.com/article/20130328/FEATURES01/130328024/Texting-in-traffic-Adults-worse-than-teens">new study funded by AT&amp;T</a> finds that adults actually text while driving more than kids. The study was taken from a pool of 1,011 consumers. </p>
<p>According to the survey, nearly half of all adults text while driving, whereas slightly fewer (43 percent) of teens admit to texting while driving. Perhaps worse, 98 percent adults who text while driving admit that they know it&#8217;s wrong but they do it anyways. </p>
<p>The survey was put together as part of AT&amp;T&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://itcanwait.com/">It Can Wait</a> campaign. If you&#8217;ve bought a phone from AT&amp;T in the last year or watched any television, you know what I&#8217;m talking about. The It Can Wait campaign shows heartbreaking stories of young adults and teens who&#8217;ve become disabled or lost a loved one due to texting while driving. </p>
<p>According to the National Safety Council, the number of adult drivers (180 million far outweighs the number of teen drivers (around 10 million). And the Center for Disease Control says that there are an average of nine people killed in texting-related accidents each day, with 1,060 injured in texting-related crashes. </p>
<p>Since texting occupies your eyes, hands, and mind, it&#8217;s considered one of the most dangerous distractions on the road, and elevates the risk of a crash to 23 times worse than driving while not distracted. </p>
<p>Texting is the issue at hand now, but as technology continues to evolve there will be even greater distractions at the wheel. Google Glass comes to mind, though we&#8217;ve already seen <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/24/west-virginia-lawmaker-seeks-to-ban-drivers-from-wearing-head-mounted-displays-like-google-glass/">action taken</a> in some states to prevent Glass-related accidents. </p>

The phone will be available for order beginning April 16, for $249.99 with a two-year commitment.

The phone will be available for order beginning April 16, for $249.99 with a two-year commitment. Samsung had previously announced that the Galaxy S4 would be coming to the U.S. sometime in Q2 2013, and didn&#8217;t reveal launch pricing at its event earlier in March.</p>
<p>The ship date of the AT&amp;T Galaxy S4 wasn&#8217;t revealed this time around, so there&#8217;s still no guarantees about when consumers will be able to actual hold the hardware, which boasts a 5-inch 1080p display, in their hot little hands. Based on Jordan&#8217;s initial impressions, the Galaxy S4 looks like a worth successor to <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/14/samsung-galaxy-s-4-beats-the-best-with-5-inch-1080p-display-1-9ghz-processor-gesture-controls-and-a-q2-2012-release/">Samsung&#8217;s flagship smartphone role</a>. The hardware specs include either 16GB, 32GB or 64GB of internal storage, but AT&amp;T hasn&#8217;t yet specified what exactly you&#8217;ll be getting for your $250.</p>
<p>Pricing for the Galaxy S4 at AT&amp;T is interesting, since it puts the smartphone above the starting on-contract price of the iPhone 5 ($199.99 with contract), and also carries a lot more sticker shock than the $99 downpayment it&#8217;ll carry with T-Mobile when it launches with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/26/galaxy-s4-expected-to-launch-on-t-mobile-on-may-1st/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+weblogsinc%2Fengadget+(Engadget)">that carrier beginning May 1</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/kn3.jpeg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="showpad" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Riding the consumerisation of IT trend that&#8217;s <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/27/the-enterprise-cool-kids/">blowing the cobwebs off enterprise software</a>, Belgian startup <a target="_blank" href="http://www.showpad.com/">Showpad</a> &#8211; which makes iPad software for sales teams &#8212; has raised a $2 million Series A funding round from early stage European VC firm, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.hummingbird-ventures.com/">Hummingbird Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Showpad&#8217;s cloud platform hosts sales content uploaded by sales staff and administrators, which can then be accessed via the corresponding iPad software &#8212; with the idea being to make it easy for sales teams to have all the necessary sales &amp; marketing info on tap when they&#8217;re in front of prospective customers. The latest version of the content required by each user is downloaded locally to their device so it can be accessed offline. Analytics for creating reports on user/content activity within the app are built in to the platform. Usage data can also be exported.</p>
<p>The system also allows administrators to send push notifications, offering a way to communicate with sales staff via in-app broadcasts &#8211; a similar feature to the private mobile messaging offering of startups such as <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/21/kentucky-based-startup-red-e-app-raises-750k-series-a-to-shout-about-its-email-busting-real-time-messaging-platform-for-mobile-workers/">Red e App</a>. Showpad is being a little more targeted, though, zeroing in on the specific needs of sales teams, rather than on mobile staff generally. CEO Pieterjan Bouten says it&#8217;s competing with the likes of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.skura.com/index.php">Skura</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.modelmetrics.com/">Model Metrics</a> (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/14/salesforce-acquires-social-and-mobile-cloud-computing-consultancy-model-metrics/">acquired by Salesforce</a>) and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scrollmotion.com/">ScrollMotion</a>.</p>
<p>In a press release, Showpad said it plans to use the funding to grow its own sales and marketing team, and to &#8220;invest heavily&#8221; in platform development. It also plans to open an office in New York to ramp up to meet &#8220;increasing demand&#8221; in the U.S., as well as look for partnership opportunities. In October last year it <a target="_blank" href="http://www.showpad.com/blog/2012/10/showpad-powers-jive-present-a-powerful-sales-and-training-ipad-app-to-enhance-sales-team-productivity/">announced a partnership</a> with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/">Jive Software</a> which is using its software to power its own mobile sales team offering, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jivesoftware.com/social-business/platform/whats-new/present/">Jive Present</a>.</p>
<p>Showpad, which was founded in 2011 &#8212; and does not currently support Android tablets &#8211; told TechCrunch it has almost 150 enterprises signed up as customers, and more than 20,000 active users of its software. Customers include BASF, Unilever and Heineken.</p>
<p>Confirming the &#8216;bottom up&#8217;, consumerisation of IT momentum Showpad is riding, Bouten added: &#8220;We manage to sign many companies through sales reps themselves trying our solution and then showing it to the management.&#8221;</p>
<p>Commenting on the funding round in a statement, Barend Van den Brande, Managing Partner of Hummingbird Ventures, said: “We have been more than pleasantly surprised with the excellent feedback we have been receiving from leading customers and partners of Showpad in Europe and in the United States. We hope that our funding will help to accelerate the company’s continuing international expansion.”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/samsung-stores.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="samsung-stores" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Samsung will reportedly be launching Samsung Stores in select Best Buy locations ahead of the Galaxy S4&#8242;s U.S. launch, a new report from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.geek.com/articles/mobile/best-buy-adding-samsung-stores-in-time-for-galaxy-s4-launch-20130328/">Geek.com</a> claims. The new sections, which will occupy spots close to the mobile department, will feature Samsung branding throughout and highlight a number of Samsung products, not just the upcoming Galaxy S4, though that flagship device will be the core focus.</p>
<p>The report from Geek.com says that at first the Samsung Stores will only be appearing at certain high-traffic locations, with training to begin for employees in the mobile departments at those stores soon. The store-within-a-store concept will roll out to other Best Buys following the launch later this year, with the ultimate goal of puting one in every U.S. location. We&#8217;ve reached to both Best Buy and Samsung for comment, but have yet to hear back at publication time.</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a good precedent for this sort of thing at Best Buy specifically, and it was set by a company that Samsung is generally keen to emulate: Apple. Apple&#8217;s dedicated mini-stores in Best Buy locations are unique in that they replicate almost exactly the in-store displays of Apple products in the company&#8217;s own standalone retail stores. It sounds like Samsung&#8217;s new in-store locations will resemble the Apple versions in both form and function, with the main intent being to have staff and space to properly demonstrate Samsung&#8217;s devices separate from those made by other OEMs.</p>
<p>If these Samsung Stores become a reality, it&#8217;s likely going to have the most effect on its fellow Android smartphone manufacturers, rather than Apple, however. Samsung is already setting itself apart from the competition in terms of market reach and global sales, but distinguishing itself on the physical retail floor will institutionalize a choice between Samsung and &#8216;all the rest&#8217; for in-store shoppers.</p>
<p>Samsung is getting bolder in its marketing efforts, as was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/14/what-just-happened/">painfully apparent from its lavish, confusing Broadway spectacle</a> earlier this month. If it wants to stand out, physically separating itself inside of Best Buy locations is another very good way to do so.</p>

The team has pushed the LinkedIn integration a step forward by bringing the entire profile into the app. Now you can check previous work experiences and education from Sunrise&#8217;s interface. &#8220;The feedback we got from our launch is that Sunrise really changes your calendar,&#8221; co-founder Pierre Valade said in a phone interview. &#8220;Using your calendar becomes a true pleasure,&#8221; he continued. During its initial development, the team really focused on the user experience because they found that other apps were lacking in this area. But the company also received two other pieces of feedback regarding Facebook Connect and event features. Users didn&#8217;t want to use their Facebook account to create a Sunrise account. So it added the ability to log in with Google &#8212; Sunrise only works with Google Calendar for now. Heavy calendar users also requested two new features that come with today&#8217;s update. You can now create recurring events directly from your phone and you can add notes to your events. This data is synchronized with your Google Calendar. &#8220;There are still a lot of features that we want to implement,&#8221; Valade said. &#8220;This update shows that we are still adding value to your calendar by using existing data from LinkedIn and other services,&#8221; he continued. Now, when you create an event and invite someone, you&#8217;ll get LinkedIn information, links to Facebook, your address book and LinkedIn, and the ability to text, call or email someone very easily. The app also uses Facebook profile pictures and cover photos. While Sunrise is not an address book, that contact info is very informative yet doesn&#8217;t require any effort on your part. The New York-based company now plans to release regular update addressing top feature requests more or less every month. It remains to be seen whether they&#8217;ll port the app to other platforms in the future as well.]]></description>

The company will offer their first guitars for a $700 pledge, not bad for a hand-made guitar from rockabilly city.</p>
<p>The company is looking for $50,000 to start and they&#8217;ve just passed the $6,000 mark.</p>
<p>The company already <a target="_blank" href="https://monikerguitars.com/guitar-configurator/">customizes solid-body guitars</a> and hopes that the fund will help them build a line of semi-hollow-body models.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through our online guitar configurator you can choose your guitar&#8217;s shape, paint colors and parts, as well as add custom text and graphics; all at the price of an off-the-shelf guitar,&#8221; write founders Kevin Tully and Dave Barry. Moniker began in Austin in 2012.</p>
<span class='embed-youtube' style='text-align:center; display: block;'><iframe class='youtube-player' type='text/html' width='640' height='390' src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/e1IEhW7cmQ4?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' frameborder='0'></iframe></span>
<p>&#8220;The money we hope to raise will go towards the tools and equipment needed to efficiently manufacture these guitars at our shop in Austin,TX. An efficient manufacturing process means we&#8217;ll be able to create high quality, yet affordably priced, semi-hollow guitars. We also need help funding the materials needed to produce these guitars on a larger scale. These materials include wood, primer, sandpaper paint, clearcoat, guitar parts, etc.&#8221;</p>
<p>The luthiers do most of their work in Austin and for a pledge of $350 they&#8217;ll strip and repaint your current guitar with a new color. You can also get a White Stripes-esque red and white model for $900. $2,400 gets you a lesson in guitar-smithing with the guys at Moniker.</p>
<p>As it gets easier to make things overseas it&#8217;s refreshing to see these guys attempting to build a local company. Customization is a hard job and it makes sense to keep the gear, supplies, and workers close to the consumer.</p>

Digital magazine app Zinio will be making its Windows Phone 8 debut in the coming weeks, and it will do so as a Nokia Lumia exclusive.</p>
<p>In making the leap to Windows Phone 8, Zinio has also undergone a substantial overhaul to boot. The app’s core features — buying, downloading, and displaying digital versions of magazines — are all there, but with this Windows Phone 8 release Zinio is starting to refocus its smartphone experience around the process of discovering new content from multiple sources rather than simply diving into individual magazines as you would with the iOS and Android versions of the app.</p>
<p>“We want to revisit what we had formerly done on the smartphone form factor,” said Zinio User Experience VP Matt Davis, which means that the forthcoming Windows Phone 8 version of the app will look nothing like its other mobile cousins (not that it’s any sort of surprise) for the time being. The star of the show in the revamped Zinio app is the new reading list, a constantly-updating stream of articles culled from “trending magazines” as well as magazines the user purchased or has subscribed to. To help keep that stream full of the right content, users are also able to set their own certain areas of interest (think technology or entertainment) so popular articles pertaining to those topics will be downloaded in the background.</p>
<p>Zinio ultimately hopes to use its Windows Phone build as an archetype for the iOS and Android experience, one of the few times we’ve seen a developer try to push the design envelope on WP first and translate the experience to other platforms later. That said, it’s certainly not a bad thing — early images of the work-in-progress Zinio app are pretty impressive in comparison:</p>

<p>Both Nokia and Zinio refer to this arrangement as a “mutual partnership,” but I can’t shake the feeling that Nokia has more to gain here. Chris Surowiec, Nokia’s head of business and app development for global partners, told me yesterday that these sorts of partnerships are “absolutely critical to selling devices,” and that Nokia is looking at Zinio’s forthcoming arrival as a major boon for the Windows Phone content ecosystem.</p>
<p>“90 percent of smartphone owners have searched for and downloaded a magazine title,” Surowiec noted, adding that “currently there’s no newsstand in the Windows Phone 8 ecosystem.” That may be true, but here&#8217;s hoping that Nokia has more of these sorts of deals up its sleeves. The Lumia line as a whole seems to be doing rather well &#8212; Nokia reported selling 4.4 million Lumia devices in <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/24/nokia-q4-2012-beats-the-street-on-sales-of-10-7b-eps-of-e0-08/">its fiscal fourth Q4</a> and recent reports point to two million Lumias sold in China &#8212; but there&#8217;s no such thing as too much traction, especially as Nokia aims to topple some major rivals.</p>

<p>The company has been around since 2008, launching just a year after one of their biggest competitors, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/bonobos">Bonobos</a>. The company has been experimenting with a new program as well, erecting pop-up shops to gain more traffic and higher engagement from users.</p>
<p>In early March, Indochino launched its <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/03/02/indochino-mixes-virtual-tailors-with-the-real-plans-pop-up-stores-in-us-this-year/">Traveling Tailor Program</a>, which brings pop-up stores to various cities and lets gentlemen be fitted in real life.</p>
<p>According to the founders, the Series B round will help Indochino continue its marketing programs (including Traveling Tailor) as well as bring new styles and designs to its users, such as the Ultimate Spring Line.</p>

Participating retailers include,<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/04/google-is-building-a-same-day-amazon-prime-competitor-google-shopping-express/"> as we&#8217;ve previously reported</a>: Target, Walgreens, Staples, American Eagle, Toys“R”Us/Babies“R”Us, Office Depot, San Francisco’s Blue Bottle Coffee, Raley’s Nob Hill Foods, and Palo Alto Toy &amp; Sport.</p>
<p>Our original report asserted that this service was trying to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/prime">price itself competitively to Amazon</a> at around $69 &#8211; $64 a year, but Google is still working on its pricing plan and will be re-evaluting it as data comes in from early testers and retailers. Early testers will be getting six months of free, same day delivery via the platform, with items costing the same as they do in store.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I for one am excited about the prospect of getting my Blue Bottle when I want it, and would be chuffed to be part of the Google beta test assuming it&#8217;s delivering hot, fresh coffee and not just bags of beans. Something tells me I won&#8217;t however, and I have no idea how Google will be on-boarding its testers today.</p>
<p>(You can sign up to apply to be a tester <a target="_blank" href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/expressshoppers/">here</a>. And retailers that want to get involved can go <a target="_blank" href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/expressretailers/">here</a>.)</p>
<p>On the consumer side, the idea is consumer convenience. &#8220;Hopefully, no more trips across town for simple errands,&#8221; writes Tom Fallows, the product management director for Google Shopping Express, in a <a target="_blank" href="http://googlecommerce.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/calling-all-sf-bay-area-residents-help.html">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>And despite the uncertainty around pricing and other logistics, Google Shopping Express will be a boon for retailers, too, allowing them to engage new customers as the userbase takes advantage of the fact that they can shop multiple retailers with all the items delivered simultaneously. In addition to new lead gen, the benefits also include increasing purchase volume from existing customers because of convenience.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s gotten into the eCommerce convenience game. Watch your backs eTailers.</p>

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Exceptional.io tracks errors in over 6,000 web applications. The service reports errors in real-time and gathers the information developers need to fix the issues fast. Airbrake, which was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/07/exceptional-acquires-error-tracking-application-airbrake/">acquired by Exceptional last year,</a> collects errors generated by other applications and aggregates the results for review.</p>
<p>Another Exceptional product with will be integrated into Rackspace is Redis To Go, makes managing Redis instances with fast caching and easier in-memory dataset operations deployed on demand.</p>
<p>Exceptional Cloud Services&#8217; products are currently used by more than 50,000 application developers, including Exec, HotelTonight, Oracle, TaskRabbit and Zendesk</p>
<p>As Pat Matthew, senior VP of corporate development as Rackspace explains, this acquisition is part of helping give developers key technologies and tools &#8220;help them deliver more reliable customer experiences and to bring the next generation of cloud-based apps to market faster.”</p>
<p>Rackspace acquired Mailgun, a Y Combinator-backed startup that gave developers API for creating and managing online email inboxes for apps and websites, in August 2012, and most recently, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techmeme.com/130227/p42#a130227p42">ObjectRocket,</a> a cloud-based commercial provider of MongoDB services.</p>
<p>The company says that the acquisition of Exceptional Cloud Services will also help advance Rackspace’s push into the MongoDB market, as the company plans to integrate Redis To Go with the MongoDB database as a service from ObjectRocket. This will allow developers to store the most recent data they have on a MongoDB for faster access, while providing data tools like lists, hashes and sorts.</p>

So why not let people sell things on their blogs? That&#8217;s what ShopLocket hopes to do now, by integrating with WordPress and launching a plugin to enable in-blog e-commerce.</p>
<p>WordPress, of course, powers a cubic buttload of web sites around the world, including the one that you&#8217;re reading now.* And no doubt, a number of ShopLocket sellers have blogs of their own, to talk about their products. So it seems like a no-brainer that the two would work together. </p>
<p>Previously, users with self-hosted versions of WordPress could enable e-commerce through third-party plugins. But this is the first integration to take advantage of a platform like ShopLocket&#8217;s for users of WordPress&#8217;s hosted platform.    </p>
<p>To enable this brave new world of blog-based e-commerce, ShopLocket has introduced a WordPress plugin that will enable users of the platform to quickly make their goods available on their sites. With the integration, WordPress Enterprise and VIP users will be able to easily embed items for sale anywhere they wish to, whether that be in posts, separate pages, or even through various sidebars on their sites.</p>
<p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/?attachment_id=787027" rel="attachment wp-att-787027"></a></p>
<p>The best part, though, is probably for buyers. That&#8217;s because they&#8217;ll no longer have to add an item to a shopping cart and then go to a separate website to login and check out. Through the integration, users will be able to make purchases directly on the site. By keeping users on-site during purchase, ShopLocket can help sellers increase engagement and lower the amount of dropoff that inevitably happens during the sale conversion process.</p>
<p>For WordPress users, ShopLocket provides an easy, cost-effective way to start selling items online. There are no upfront costs to get set up, and the company charges just a nominal fee per transaction (2.5%, plus credit card processing fees). The company was part of the Toronto-based <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/15/meet-the-first-5-companies-to-join-toronto-incubator-extreme-startups/">startup incubator Extreme Startups</a> last year and has raised $1 million in seed funding from Valar Ventures, Rho Canada Ventures, and others.</p>

* More than 60 million sites, and growing, apparently. </p>

<p>The financial terms of the deals aren&#8217;t being disclosed, but HubSpot says it&#8217;s bringing on the full Chime and PrepWork teams and moving them from Toronto and New Haven, Conn., respectively, to the company headquarters in Cambridge, Mass. And these aren&#8217;t just talent acquisitions. I spoke to Vice President of Product Strategy and Corporate Development Brad Coffey and Chief Product Officer David Cancel about the deal, and while they didn&#8217;t get too specific about their product integration plans, they did say HubSpot is going to incorporate the Chime and PrepWork services to its offerings in some form.</p>
<p>Chime is a Google Chrome plug-in that brings the notifications from a user&#8217;s various web apps together into a single feed. PrepWork, meanwhile, sends automated briefing emails to prepare users for upcoming meetings (with content like recent blog posts and social network profiles for whoever they&#8217;re meeting with).</p>
<p>Coffey argued that both apps fit into a broader theme: &#8220;An important part of inbound marketing is having these personalized conversations and enabling these personalized conversations.&#8221; Cancel said both products were used by the HubSpot team prior to the acquisition, and they help HubSpot to expand its tools beyond emails and websites.</p>
<p>These are the company&#8217;s third and fourth acquisitions. It was <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/16942/Why-HubSpot-Acquired-Marketing-Automation-Company-Performable.aspx">the earlier purchase of Performable</a> that brought Cancel to the team, so he&#8217;s seen the HubSpot acquisition process from the other side, too. The thing that convinced him to join HubSpot, and that he&#8217;s looking for in acquisitions, is a fit of culture and vision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Product will evolve and change over time, so it&#8217;s really having the same kind of mission, the same kind of cultural values, that is the number one thing,&#8221; Cancel said.</p>
<p>HubSpot <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/11/05/eyeing-an-ipo-marketing-software-giant-hubspot-raises-35m-for-international-growth-ma-and-more/">raised a $35 million mezzanine round last fall</a>. Coffey said that money was intended, in part, to fund deals like this, so we can probably expect more announcements in the months to come.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/iphone-wraparound.png?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="iphone-wraparound" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>Apple has a new <a target="_blank" href="http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;r=29&amp;p=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PG01&amp;S1=(apple.AS.+AND+20130328.PD.)&amp;OS=an/apple+and+pd/3/28/2013&amp;RS=(AN/apple+AND+PD/20130328)">patent filing just published by the USPTO </a>today, first spotted by <a target="_blank" href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/03/28/apple-looking-into-futuristic-device-with-wrap-around-display-and-seamless-glass-housing">AppleInsider</a>, which details a wraparound-style AMOLED display that could make it possible to create an iPhone that&#8217;s almost entirely screen, with touch gestures and virtual buttons replacing physical ones completely. The patent describes designs that could have a seamless, continuous surface resembling the fourth generation iPod nano, as well as other shapes closer to the current iPhone, but with every surface a touch-sensitive glass display.</p>
<p>The patent is a fairly comprehensive one, and even mentions built-in facial recognition as well as a method of layering flexible, see-through displays on top of one another in order to produce different visual effects, including the appearance of 3D. The glass used to encase the display is described as either seamless, or featuring small design elements to hide where one piece joins another. One major advantage is that glass is relatively radio transparent, which is why the current generation iPhone 5 has top and bottom glass &#8220;window&#8221; panels on the backside of its casing, and another, says Apple in the filing, is the aesthetic advantage.</p>
<p>Apple suggests a number of different device designs representing different geometric shapes that could be used with an all-encompassing external glass display, but even more interesting, in some it talks about removable end caps that could allow more than one device to be joined together. Like Voltron, when combined these iPhones or iOS mobile devices would become greater than the sum of their parts.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/iphone-designs.png"></a>Another neat trick is the way in which the proposed device would recognize what touch to treat as important, and which to ignore, since the entire phone is essentially one big touchscreen. Apple describes a way of detecting how a user is actually handling the device to solve that problem, using on-board cameras and facial recognition to figure out where to display content, and where to register touch.</p>
<p>The final element of the patent is a version that contains layered, transparent displays that can each show different content, or layers of a single image to achieve 3D effects. It could also be used to place a HUD or additional information on top of another image, essentially building a second-screen or augmented reality experience into a single device.</p>
<p>This is one of the more exciting Apple patents that has surfaced lately, as it demonstrates essentially a completely re-imagined next-generation iOS smartphone. But the technology is probably still a ways off from being economically practical, and the battery demands of a completely wraparound display would also likely be astronomical. So while I wouldn&#8217;t expect this in iPhone 6 (or even 7), it&#8217;s a good look at how the company is thinking about innovation behind the scenes.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="100" height="70" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/z10-6.jpg?w=100&amp;h=70&amp;crop=1" class="attachment-tc-carousel-river-thumb wp-post-image" alt="z10-6" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 7px 0;" /><p>For the past year BlackBerry has been trying to prove to the world that it’s not a mobile has-been just yet, and that all came to a head earlier this year when the company finally released the BlackBerry 10 mobile OS to the masses. While the company’s future is still unclear, BlackBerry released its <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/news-sources/?date=20130328&amp;archive=ccnm&amp;slug=201303280863078001">fiscal Q4 2013 earnings</a> early this morning and they’re more impressive than you would expect for a company going through some major upheavals.</p>
<p>BlackBerry reported earnings of <strong>$0.22 per share </strong>on <strong>$2.7 billion in revenue</strong> &#8212; that works out to an adjusted net income of $114 million. That may not seem <em>great</em> at first glance, but bear in mind the rough patch that the company has been going through (not to mention the lowered forecasts that come with it). Wall Street’s expectations for the ailing Canadian company were pretty grim — the consensus according to Bloomberg Businessweek forecasted a loss of $0.28 per share on revenues of $2.8 billion. In case you haven’t been keeping track, that’s still down significantly from the $0.80 EPS and $4.6 billion in revenue that BlackBerry (still RIM at the time) reported in the year-ago quarter but BlackBerry handily beat those low expectations and then some.</p>
<p>As such, it&#8217;s not much of a surprise to see that BlackBerry&#8217;s stock price is up roughly 5% in pre-market trading at time of writing, and BlackBerry is eagerly stoking that enthusiasm by noting that the company will &#8220;approach breakeven financial results” next quarter.</p>
<p>Perhaps more importantly, this earnings release gives us our first real glimpse at how the company&#8217;s new BlackBerry 10 smartphone is faring after its launch earlier this year. According to BlackBerry, the company has shipped a total of 6 million smartphones this past quarter with roughly 1 million of those being newer, higher-margin Z10 units.</p>
<p>To be clear, BlackBerry isn&#8217;t out of the woods yet. This time around, the company reported that its subscriber base was holding steady at 76 million, down from the 79 million reported last December. There&#8217;s no official reason given, but a dearth of new BlackBerry 7 hardware in the months leading up to the BlackBerry 10 launch is a likely culprit &#8212; those lower-cost devices are still the bread and butter of BlackBerry&#8217;s business, and a shift in focus towards more expensive BB10 units probably stymied growth. BlackBerry needs to figure out how to bring BlackBerry 10 to the masses in a big way, lest it yield its hard-fought position to a sea of cheap Android phones. Shipments are down 38% year-over-year, as is the company&#8217;s research and development spending.</p>
<p>The bigger question at play here is about how much stock we should be putting in this particular release. After all, the thing to remember here is that BlackBerry is right smack in the middle of a tremendous transition period. Since the company’s last earnings release BlackBerry has been awfully busy launching its next generation mobile OS and the smartphone that runs it in markets across the globe. Its going to be the next few earnings release that paint a better picture of BlackBerry&#8217;s odds of survival in the long term, but hey &#8212; this isn&#8217;t a bad start.</p>
<p>This earnings release also marks the end of an era &#8212; former RIM co-CEO Mike Lazaridis has announced that he will step down as Vice Chair and Director of the company, presumably to spend more time managing his $100<a target="_blank" href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/tech-news/mike-lazaridiss-new-quantum-leap/article9971663/?service=mobile"> quantum computing venture capital fund</a>. His longtime partner Jim Balsillie finally severed his own ties by dumping his stake in BlackBerry <a target="_blank" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57569379-94/ex-blackberry-co-ceo-jim-balsillie-dumps-entire-stake/">this past February</a>.</p>
