Your mirror reflects a larger portion of the light striking its surface, by the metallic film affixed to the glass, the silicon based medium which holds it; most substances diffuse the light and reflect a smaller portion yet allow none to pass through. The glass without the metallic reflective film would not reflect much of the light, as you know.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  The cloaking device takes into account all of these effects; and creates an energy field to act as does a mirror with one significant difference; the mirror would reflect; the device used &ldquo;sees&rdquo; as you would say, the image and the light approaching the object to be hidden, to be cloaked. It recreates the same electromagnetic energy and re-transmits it from the otherwise visible side of the object; it &ldquo;copies&rdquo; what would be seen in the absence of the object.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  A similar process occurs with your photography and also your music and electromagnetic waves of transmission in the frequencies of your dimensions; these can be detected and copied, but to an extent too limited to achieve what you will see demonstrated, at some later occasion. <br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  The device reads the light energy that strikes it and re-transmits this; this is easy as your light is limited to your measurements of 300,000 of your kilometers per one of your seconds; in the higher dimensions this is slow, thus easy to replicate; it is conceptually similar to capture and recreation of sound waves, yet the replication is exact, as it is with a mirror image reflected.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  The higher speeds of the dimensions we achieve and in which we exist, allow this.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could we use such device on Earth?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><br>T: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, we could give you one; it would require no energy that you yet know and would work perfectly. It would not affect your environment. We would not do this.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why not?</em><br>T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be sold for use as a weapon; it would be used to conceal armament and to gain advantage, for financial gain. You remain mired in a dense concept of money and cast aside things of value for it, applying the reverse of truth. The money has no value; it is simply an idea without substance. &nbsp;<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why isn&rsquo;t this device used to conceal presence elsewhere?</em><br>T: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We would never attack and no need for this would there be, in an aggressive or warlike way. Even if this were attempted, our presence could not be cloaked; this device only works inter-dimensionally, from a faster to a lesser speed.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Earth we speak of higher vibrations and ascension into them and many of us would enjoy this, as we understand it.</em><br>T: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Certainly, and we say a large attraction is that this ascension represents an elevation above something to which it is compared; some value is placed in the sensation of higher and thus better, by comparison to surroundings. When a rise or ascension to a higher range of vibrations occurs, this notion is cast aside and sensations of this sort, that one has risen and feels elevated, these change significantly from what is perceived now. Yes ascension would occur yet it will be far different and provide greater understanding.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this the reason no attack would occur?</em><br>T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes; battles and conflicts have already occurred many times as our civilization developed to provide the technology now used to visit your planet. The ability to use technology for destruction has long been established, understood and been seen as futile. All possessors of it understand its use against perceived foes will not work, as they have abilities to detect, defend, repel and destroy by response. Because all possess such ability means it is not considered; its use in this way produces no gain; there is no change to gain. <br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this aspect of Earth an attraction?</em><br>T: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Yes; many aspects of your collective behaviors fascinate us, and much of our visitation revolves around observance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hear much commentary you have had contact with leaderships of governments and this is all kept very quiet. Is this true and why?</em><br>T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, many visitors are allowed to visit and make good contact. There has been resistance as your technology developed and our visits were then taken seriously, as the attempts to resist our presence were neutralized. Still your leadership does not know what methods we use and because of this, we are either respected or feared. Humanity remains stuck in a mode of power and its use.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why are we not contacted directly, around governments?</em><br>T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are, as occurs now.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why governments first?</em><br>T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Governments are you; you create them. They are to represent you, no? Disagreement there might be at this, as we have had this cycle many times, yet you maintain and renew it and thus, we are reluctant to cast it aside as irrelevant. We are now doing both in a larger way, and you are reading contact now.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When are we going to see what we call alien visitors on Earth?</em><br>T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will not observe us walking about; this would serve only a bad purpose. It is also difficult as existence in your environment is not easy for many of us, for many physiological reasons. We prefer to remain aboard ships. There are other visitors that have and might do more; we speak only of ourselves.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q: &nbsp; &nbsp; So far, distance to the Pleiades star cluster and also the Sirius twins has been mentioned, but only. Where is your home, your base and why are you here?</em><br>T: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are neither Sirian nor Pleiadean, we are from a star nearby you call Canopus. <br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will humans be given the opportunity to visit your homes?</em><br>T: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Not yet; a time will come, generations from now, as you have them upon Earth. Your bodies are fragile away from your atmosphere, as are all bodies and types and this will require some advance planning but most of al, it must be for your purposes and advances. Little in this way would be served.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can any being approach Earth and visit as you do?</em><br>T: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No; permission must be gained and resistance there is to some, who would like to visit and mine your planet. There are others who would disturb life to your collective detriment.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You Canopians, can you be called this? Why do you come?</em><br>T: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Observe, study, compare to history and understand development. We like this name for us, we use it not.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s return, if we might, to space travel. Aboard a vessel, are there windows to look outside?</em><br>T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, this is not necessary. <br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We depict a ship travelling through space as if stars and other visible objects are passed as we might see trees along a roadway; is this accurate?</em><br>T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The speed of light is not a factor; your perception of the spectrum of light at the speeds you are able to recognize and detect is what gives rise to this notion. As there is a spectrum of visible and invisible light to your eyes, so there is also a spectrum of speeds and you are at the lower end; the light you see from a star you deem to be distant and requiring of many of your lifetimes to have its light reach you? This light you see is the residual, cast off which strays into your dimensionality; the light energy traverses the galaxy many times faster, and even our travel does not attain these velocities.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what is seen during the voyage from a star in the Pleiades cluster to Earth? Or from Canopus? </em><br>T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing; visible images fade and a grayish fog are all to be observed. As the voyage concludes, we return to the spectrums and see all colors and images again.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the galaxy colorful?</em><br>T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a kaleidoscope of a forest; imagine every hue and shade of all colors you might see, all expressed in all the plants and growths and beings of our forest; this is the appearance of the galaxy.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What your vessels made of?</em><br>T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You do not have this material.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it an alloy of anything we have?</em><br>T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, we have some components of metals on your Earth, other you know not. Metals we create and alloys from them you cannot yet produce.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do you move and propel your ships?</em><br>T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Magnetism.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do we defy gravity?</em><br>T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you do now; for example, the way it is suspended inside a space vessel far above your planet&rsquo;s surface or as it can be made to disappear during the trajectory of a flight in your winged craft, these conditions are all able to be replicated with magnetism.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will we be able to defy gravity on Earth?</em><br>T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, you could do this now and have.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is this not more widespread?</em><br>T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will change your existence and civilizations and the value of life on Earth would be changed. You have not yet chosen to make this change.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is the &ldquo;you&rdquo; mentioned in your answer?</em><br>T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You on Earth and all souls and groups who have chosen to visit and know Earth, and the very few courageous ones that live upon it now, such as you who type this and you who read these words. You, the Earth body leaders of these great group, all of you have chosen the course you now follow.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who organizes all this and protects Earth?</em><br>T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The large hierarchy of all beings throughout the galaxy and universe.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Visitor from Canopus, thank you.</em><br>T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are all welcome.<br><span style=""></span></div> <hr style="width:100%;clear:both;visibility:hidden;"></hr>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[ Exorcism]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.theamendment.net/6/post/2013/04/exorcism.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.theamendment.net/6/post/2013/04/exorcism.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2013 15:16:29 GMT</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.theamendment.net/6/post/2013/04/exorcism.html</guid><description><![CDATA[Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is going on with this, what is to be learned from it?

And how should you perform an exorcism? What is the most successful way to get a negative spirit to leave? </em><br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>    A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;This is the most extreme form of what is called schizophrenia in your science of psychiatry. It is arranged and planned; remember Guardian Angels and Guides? [The Committee smiles broadly as this is said] The invasion of a body would not be allowed unless planned. We suggest your sleep; you depart and travel and many things you do; these images of dreams are not images; only this they seem to be as recalled and remembered. Would not the occupation of your body be done best whilst <i>[yes, Erik] </i>you are away? This does not happen; the appearance of the alternate personality is manifested only awake.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  The condition is undertaken as it will provide opportunity and effect for the souls involved, and we say there can be more than one visitor, there can be many. The host soul agrees to allow visitors a short or brief experience in a body, without benefit of having grown and learned; this gives the opportunity to see what a body life in dense matter on Earth would be like. <br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  Great obstacles there are, as these visitors appear without experience of a life in a body and the sensations and feelings are new and difficult to assume; no memory of human interaction has there been and thus behavior appears to those surrounding the visitor, as you who know of this have understood.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  The performance of an exorcism is a human attempt, and we say with kindness and compassion, a feeble one, to gain control over that which you control not. It is done for your purpose, as you feel pressure to assist and remedy, faced with social guilt for standing aside and allowing it, yet this is likely the better course.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  The successful way to have the visitor depart is ask, and this requires recognition and understanding of the process. The negation of the existence of soul presences, in ourselves and others, and a reality beyond human density impedes the understanding that would most efficiently dispatch the perceived invader.&rdquo;<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span></div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[ Art from above]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.theamendment.net/6/post/2013/04/art-from-above.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.theamendment.net/6/post/2013/04/art-from-above.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Tue, 02 Apr 2013 17:20:55 GMT</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.theamendment.net/6/post/2013/04/art-from-above.html</guid><description><![CDATA[Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you tell us specifically which science fictions are channelled if we were to give you a list?

You have not, yet such desire takes from you control you always have. This you cannot do. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  You cannot give away control; it might be temporarily seized from under you on Earth; yet this happening is often a choice made long ago, a choice you choose to recall not.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  If this life you describe as difficult, if it ends now, where will you go? Your hope would be to go where is it less difficult and as you understand, easy. Your expectation of easy will include the circumstances and surroundings of your place now, the difficulties subtracted. The departure will indeed alter the difficulties and the surroundings will be equally modified and often is the case, by a greater or larger effect. We can say with certainty, you will regret the removal of the surroundings that comes with the change in difficulty.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Your plan to live a life path and course cut short but for your frustration, unhappiness and dislike of what you have experienced, this desire is a part of the experience you have planned and encountered; to finish it before completion, to end it before it is done, to terminate before its arrival will cause you regret and repentance as you understand these emotions, in larger effect and amount than you can know on Earth. It will feel to you as if progress made, real and valid and beneficial to you, was wasted, thrown away and disposed. This is not the case yet feel this way, you will. So you will long to reincarnate to repair and re-do the termination so precipitous, as you have before and many of you do now.&rdquo;<br /><span style=""></span></div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[ SPACE TRAVEL]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.theamendment.net/6/post/2013/03/space-travel.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.theamendment.net/6/post/2013/03/space-travel.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2013 16:30:33 GMT</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.theamendment.net/6/post/2013/03/space-travel.html</guid><description><![CDATA[  [...] ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class='imgPusher' style='float:left;height:0px'></span><span style='z-index:10;position:relative;float:left;;clear:left;margin-top:0px;*margin-top:0px'><a><img src="http://www.theamendment.net/uploads/8/0/3/0/8030819/1365002269.jpg" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px; border-width:1px;padding:3px;" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorderBlack" /></a><div style="display: block; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;"></div></span> <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;display:block;"><em style="">Q = Questioner T = Unidentified Space Traveler Alien Guest Being</em><br /><em style=""><br />Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why and how can beings from physical places, like the Pleiades star cluster, said to be about 425 light years distant, or Sirius at about 8&frac12; light years of travel to Earth, or any other place, come within the lifespan of a being from those places?</em><br /><span style=""></span><br />T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The idea of 425 years as Earth measures time is not the &ldquo;time&rdquo; required and this idea of time you hold? It is local. There is &ldquo;time&rdquo; in another physical location and it correlates not to another star. We say, the limit of the speed of light by your dimensional existence applies to your dimension; the distances you would measure by a distance light travels by one year of your time only apply to you as a resident of Earth. The concept of a parsec, the number of degree angles, this is a better measure as it considers the circular nature of the universe and distance and relativity.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So how long does it take, for a traveler from Pleiades, to reach Earth?</em><br />T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By your time, less than 100 of your minutes.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To cross 425 light years?</em><br />T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By your measure of it, yes.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To leave, arrive, do a day&rsquo;s work and return to Pleiades can be done in a day?</em><br />T: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, by one of your days. You do not have days on Earth; you have a day when combined with a place on Earth; lift yourself off the surface and hover above one spot and your days will end in the lapse of just one, by your clocks.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do the makers of crop circles hover and hang around, planning them? Or do they come from far away?</em><br />T: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These can be done by a more permanent visitor yet often are done by a day visit, as you would call it. It can be planned and done and we the makers then return to origin or travel elsewhere.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t we ever see a crop circle being made?</em><br />T: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Because you would not believe it; we do say this has happened and the observers have considered themselves crazy in some cases and others simply do not speak of it, also for concern they would be called crazy. So they are often done at night, in your darkness so there will be no observers; humans do not remain in fields of crops at night.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please explain how such distance can be traveled so quickly.</em><br />T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each movement occurs along the edge of a circle, ever larger or smaller as a destination is pursued or followed or desired to be visited. There is no distance in a line, which as you would see this on Earth. We take your planet as an example; how many have known, in the western world, that digging a hole deep enough will lead to China? As a round globe is understood, indeed a hole would allow this, from the opposite area. This notion comes from your true understanding of your home of Heaven. The distance across your surface is farther than through the center; this is as it happens in outer space, the area around your planet.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The straight line is shorter, the curved longer but you say space travel is shorter along the curved and longer by what we&rsquo;d call the straight one?</em><br />T: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The concepts of straight and curved on Earth do not apply away from your planet; you even force yourself into this view inside your solar system, yet as you know, it is a series of circles. On Earth the curved surface and the line through are of the same medium and dimension and so in this way are meaningful to each other; off your Earth, the opposite more true relation exists.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So how does the Pleiadian reach Earth?</em><br />T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The vessel used will reach the edge of the larger circuitous route that will intersect with the larger circuitous route, the time of travel is only long the circumference of the arc, the section of the circle&rsquo;s circumference. We refer to your program of television, Star Trek, which called higher speed travel, &ldquo;warp speed&rdquo;. This is a channeled notion, because true travel through your concept of outer space &ldquo;warps&rdquo; the straight line perception of Earth humanity. In actuality, your straight line view is the warped of the two if it could be said that way.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How is this done?</em><br />T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The destination is planned by comparing destination to origin; once the angles are known the mid-point of the journey is plotted and then steps to reach the midpoint; we suggest a mortar and the trajectory of its missile, its projectile. The movement is to the apogee and then the slug will fall to its target. The vessel will traverse the gap to destination by reach the midpoint, as you might say apogee, of the journey. Unlike a gravity force drawing the ship by mass, a more simple effect is used.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the angles?</em><br />T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no up or down or left and right; so the location of each end of the journey matter by its relative position; we say, reverse a photograph and then also turn it upside down. If you reverse your view along with the photo, it appears not reversed. So is this travel; so the placement of the destination is set relative to origin and the arrangement is reversed and inverted and moved around you, the traveler, to being destination to your trajectory, as each step of inversion and reversal take place, your ship switches arc of movement and follows a different trajectory.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How are these calculated?</em><br />T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By your concepts of minutes of angle or parsecs in space; the parallax of intersection. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What propels a vessel so fast?</em><br />T: &nbsp; &nbsp;Speed as you comprehend it, this is not what occurs; density of matter to create rearrangement applies not. The movement of relativities around you can create this; we suggest a wind tunnel; does the air move and you remain stationary? Is the effect upon you the same as your movement through stationary air? Yes, and thus the notion of propulsion is the relation of movement.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a ship reaches Earth, how does it move and propel itself?</em><br />T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Magnetism; your Earth is highly magnetic and makes this task easy. All planets have this.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  <em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How does an alien ship visiting Earth disguise itself?</em><br />T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You would call this a cloaking device; as your cloak blocks light form touching you and thus light must touch the cloak and that is what you the observer see, so exactly does the device; it blocks light from touching the vessel not by covering and interception of similar dimension but rather lifting the exterior electromagnetic field above your dimension&rsquo;s limits and so light passes through.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span><em>  Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish to come back to this space travel subject.</em><br />T:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will do so happily, be well.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /><span style=""></span></div> <hr style="width:100%;clear:both;visibility:hidden;"></hr>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[ REAL PERSONALITY]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.theamendment.net/6/post/2013/03/real-personality.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.theamendment.net/6/post/2013/03/real-personality.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2013 15:07:19 GMT</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.theamendment.net/6/post/2013/03/real-personality.html</guid><description><![CDATA[Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is our soul&rsquo;s real personality?

I mean we incarnate to this planet as differing humans, each with a different set of experiences, surroundings, influences, nature and nurturing. So as we live and seek to live a harmonious life, who and what are we really like without this dense matter of flesh to shackle us? We come here many times and I understand our souls remain the same. But how do we know what our soul is really like as a personality. For example, for one lifetime we might wish to experience being a murderer and by the next lifetime we may choose to experience being a housewife or a domestic pet. These are all experiences but not truly who we are as soul beings. </em><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    C:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;You do not experience this role as a murderer for your benefit; you do this as a sacrifice and by request. Great sacrifice is made. This risk and investment are enormous. To have done it from anger, rage, bitterness or evil desire are learned on Earth and likely you will provide yourself an opportunity to relive and avoid this.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  The reality of your soul IS your life and you are, on Earth, who you are; you are a subset while here. We suggest places and roles of Earth as a comparison; does a father of family assume this role at a place of work, of employment? Does a husband treat a woman he barely knows at a store as he might his wife at home? So you see, your personality here, it is your personality. A smaller portion in many circumstances, the memories of lives past and plans forward set aside as if these were just files to be consulted later, as needed. This is all; you remain who you are and you will this always be. <br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  The dense matter of flesh shackles you not; it liberates you into the wonderful experience of Earth and all this density of existence offer. Does a new and expensive car enclose and limit you? Certainly, as you choose to see this.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Your personality is as it is; this changes not.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>  Your return to Heaven reopens the files you have put up, put away and put aside; that is all.&nbsp;<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span></div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[ physical body]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.theamendment.net/6/post/2013/03/physical-body.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.theamendment.net/6/post/2013/03/physical-body.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2013 14:50:40 GMT</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.theamendment.net/6/post/2013/03/physical-body.html</guid><description><![CDATA[  [...] ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class='imgPusher' style='float:right;height:12px'></span><span style='z-index:10;position:relative;float:right;;clear:right;margin-top:20px;*margin-top:40px'><a><img src="http://www.theamendment.net/uploads/8/0/3/0/8030819/2842509.jpg?94" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px; border-width:0;" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorderBlack" /></a><div style="display: block; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;"></div></span> <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;display:block;"><em style="">Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I often read the phrase "You are more than your physical body" and my imagination runs the gamut of what my physical mind could conjure up. It's not a lot as you know (being physical and all) Can you be a bit more specific with the &ldquo;more&rdquo;?&nbsp;</em><br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    C:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Gladly we respond. Your body is your shell, your vehicle and your suit. Your mind is your essence and is the solidity of your existence. You express through the body you have designed and come to occupy in this life; the feeling given is one of solidity and substance and this is intentional, as the sensations and feeling the body provides create the integration with surroundings. These are your life experiences; you are not this body. You existed quite solidly and substantially before this body and will remain the same substantial and solid person after the body is no longer.<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span>    We would take the physical remains of a person known well; known well to you as a relative or friend or to the general public. This person dies and as we know, the physical remains of the body disappear, in several ways. Do the memories of the person likewise disappear? So the memories remain where the body has gone. Consider yourself; why will all people who knew you well forget you after you pass on? You know, they will not as you will also remember, as you already have, all people who passed on that you did know. The memories of all of us remain with the people who will pass on after we return to our home of Heaven. In all cases, the bodies fade from existence and the memories persist; is this not true?<br /><span style=""></span><br /><span style=""></span></div> <hr style="width:100%;clear:both;visibility:hidden;"></hr>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[ Work & Downloads]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.theamendment.net/6/post/2013/03/work-downloads.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.theamendment.net/6/post/2013/03/work-downloads.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Thu, 28 Mar 2013 17:57:41 GMT</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.theamendment.net/6/post/2013/03/work-downloads.html</guid><description><![CDATA[Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard a rumour that some spirits incarnate to earth to do less work.

Because life in the afterlife is so busy, compared to living a human life on earth? 2) What roles and responsibilities do spirits usually have in the afterlife? 3) Are there schools of education in the afterlife where one would go for example to learn how to communicate with humans?&nbsp;</em><em style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 18px;">Or is the information downloaded from source 'Johnny Mnemonic' style? </em><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 18px;">(</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Mnemonic_(film))" style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 18px;">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Mnemonic_(film))</a><em style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 18px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><div><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>    C:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Work, as you understand, is activity. Activity as work includes a perception of time; your days and the cycles limit activity; essentials for bodily function such as food and rest and the common but not vital, such as bathing and maintenance of dwellings, these serve to limit activity humans deem &lsquo;work&rsquo;.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  There is no time defined by daylight, darkness and their cycles, what activity is chosen is not measured in these segments or subunits. The concept of less by incarnation applies not.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  There are incarnations to change activity in a related area, the activity on Earth to serve a purpose chosen and pursued in Heaven as the purpose relates to human life and this is common a purpose to assist humanity, very common.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  The notion of busy as it compares to relaxed is not a Heavenly relation; these two things do not define and separate in the on or off, up or down, left &amp; right way many things on Earth are seen by all of you.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  2) The afterlife of your true home is so much more complex and intricate than Earth, we do say we cannot this answer. Allow us to say there are many, many more souls related to you, and of you and knowing of you on Earth than are located in body on the surface with you. Your Earth population many, many times over is what the immediacy of Heaven is, as it could apply to Earth. There is no limit to activity, no constraint of resource as you would say; there are not social classes, races, geographical limits and no political understandings in any way that limit activity and with certainty we say, the distinct and categorized types of activity are, in addition to the vastly greater number of souls, vastly more varied, nuanced and diverse by comparison to Earth.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  3) Schools of all types there are; and frequent is the lecture, the conference and the presentation. These have the nature of a concert or show as you understand them. No tedium is there in them; popularity of such concert allows as many shows, episodes or permutations as there appear viewers desiring to attend. There can be one hundred thousand attending yet the closeness and intimacy felt by each will be as you on Earth would feel in a presentation to fifty show goers.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  There is no need to learn to communicate with humans; you are us and we are you and we both do this automatically and naturally. The difference is Earth recognition of the communications sent; all that you think, think to us and say to us, write to us and aim our way, we hear. We hear it all. We love it as we love you.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  Yes, information can be &ldquo;downloaded&rdquo; as you say, yet this implies a repository of data then copied or given access from the destination location. The information you create, store and transmit for Earth use is this way, yet no download need there be from Heaven; the information is permanent and available to anyone interested, and this includes all of you. Your Guardian Angel Guides will provide to you all you might need or want, no download necessary. You gain access and use directly.<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span>  Good day!&rdquo;&nbsp;<br><span style=""></span><br><span style=""></span></div></div>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[ TUNING IN]]></title><link><![CDATA[http://www.theamendment.net/6/post/2013/03/tuning-in.html]]></link><comments><![CDATA[http://www.theamendment.net/6/post/2013/03/tuning-in.html#comments]]></comments><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2013 20:20:25 GMT</pubDate><category><![CDATA[Uncategorized]]></category><guid isPermaLink="false">http://www.theamendment.net/6/post/2013/03/tuning-in.html</guid><description><![CDATA[  [...] ]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class='imgPusher' style='float:left;height:0px'></span><span style='z-index:10;position:relative;float:left;;clear:left;margin-top:0px;*margin-top:0px'><a><img src="http://www.theamendment.net/uploads/8/0/3/0/8030819/4165433.jpg?165" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px; border-width:1px;padding:3px;" alt="Picture" class="galleryImageBorderBlack" /></a><div style="display: block; font-size: 90%; margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: 10px; text-align: center;"></div></span> <div class="paragraph" style="text-align:justify;display:block;"><em style="">Q: &nbsp; &nbsp;What do I need to do to become more in tune with the universe and my guides? I want to receive communication from them, but don't know if it is not allowed, or if I am just not able to tune in properly? Is there anything specific to me that you can impart?&nbsp;</em><br /><br />A: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;You are in tune with the universe; perfect tune. You do receive information from them; they do not supply it like a person walking down the street and do not appear (<em style="">not often anyway</em>) like a teacher before a class, but the information comes by&nbsp;bucketfuls.<br /><br />Specifically you can separate your thoughts from your GAGs (<em style="">Guardian Angels and Guides; Guardian Angels as permanent caretakers, Guides as linked to a specific task, project or undertaking</em>)<br /><br />To listen you concentrate; your thoughts and the information must be sifted apart; imagine just this: a screen type sifter out of which falls the flour into two piles. They look the same, they seem the same but they are not. How do you know they are not the same; by RECOGNIZING they are not the same. Understanding they are different; baking soda, powdered salt, bleached flour and confectioner's sugar might all look the same, even close up. Mixed together, does not them the same make.<br /><br />Once you recognize your information comes to your mind just as that same mind - YOU - use the brain to process down to the body YOUR ideas and thoughts; that these things are all together - but - are - different; THEN the&nbsp;differences&nbsp;will be seen.<br /><br />Practice slowly and steadily; no deadline exists. There is no exam, no test and no grade for speed. The separation is there and it will become open and obvious as you practice looking for it.<br /><br />Often, when you have a quiet moment, think of the split, consider the spread, ask for the question to appear in your head (<em>The Committee is in a rhyming, poetic mood today</em>) The answer will occur to you like your own thought. It is NOT; this is communication and information from the universe. Look not upon a psychic or medium or channel of talent to expect to be this way; you are NOT that person any more than they are you; so you can be different. You are.<br /><br />Have you ever started out the door and&nbsp;suddenly&nbsp;had a hard thought of leaving behind keys/pen/purse/letter/package/cup/lunch/hat/what-have-you? We all have. This sudden and clear recall of something you would forget, this is INFORMATION coming from your GAGs. This sensation is an example we all know and have. When this sensation comes with ease and along with any&nbsp;questions&nbsp;you have asked, you have just heard your GAGs loud and clear.<br /><br />Start with quick answers; soon the longer answers will come automatically and just as easily. Long complex answers will arrive just as does the thought "house key".<br /><br />Good cake making, bakers!&nbsp;<br /></div> <hr style="width:100%;clear:both;visibility:hidden;"></hr>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
